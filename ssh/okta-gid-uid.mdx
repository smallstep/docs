### How to sync UIDs and GIDs from Okta

Smallstep can automatically sync POSIX user and group IDs for your users from your identity provider.

To set up UID and GID syncing, we're going to need our SCIM app to map those attributes from your Okta user profiles.

This feature does not sync POSIX group membership mappings. Only UID and GID values are synced.

### Step 1. Add UID and GID fields to your Okta user profile

Already have UID and GID fields for your users? Skip to Step 2.

* Start at your Okta admin panel
* Go to **Directory → Profile Editor**
* Under Filters, select **Okta**. Choose **Profile** or **User (default)** here.
* In the Profile Editor, choose **+ Add Attribute** and add a uid attribute with data type **"number"**.

  You may want to provide an Attribute Range minimum here, especially if you want to protect a range of IDs for service accounts on your hosts.

* **Save and Add Another**, then create a GID attribute with data type **"number"**.

* **Save**

### Step 2. Add UID and GID fields to your Smallstep SCIM profile

* Go to **Directory → Profile Editor**
* Search and select your **Smallstep provisioning app** profile. 
* Click the **+Add Attribute** button and add a uid attribute.
  
  Data type **number**

  Set the Display name, Variable name, and External name to `uid`

  External namespace  `urn:scim:smallstep:ssh:schema`

  The attribute should be marked **required**, because any Okta user with an empty uid or gid value won't sync to Smallstep.

  Scope ☑ **User personal**

* **Save and Add Another,** and add a gid attribute.

  Data type **number**

  Set the Display name, Variable name, and External name to `gid`

  External namespace  `urn:scim:smallstep:ssh:schema`

  The attribute should be marked **required** because any Okta user with an empty uid or gid value won't sync to Smallstep.
  
  Scope ☑ **User personal**

* **Save**

### Step 3. Add mappings from Okta to your Smallstep provisioning app

* Go to **Applications → Applications**
* Choose your **Smallstep provisioning** application
* Go to the **Provisioning** tab
* Under **Attribute Mappings**, you should see that uid and gid are not mapped.
* Edit the mapping for `uid`:

  Select a type equal to **Map from Okta Profile**
  
  Choose the **uid | number**  field.

  Apply on **Create and update**

  **Save**

  ![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-gid-createupdate.png)

* **Repeat** for `gid`.
* When you're finished, the mappings should look like this:

### Step 4. Verify syncing with Smallstep before going into production
* These changes should trigger a sync of the UID and GID values to the Smallstep console.
* If the values do not show up, try removing and re-adding the group assignments:
  * Open the **Smallstep provisioning app integration** application within OKTA.
  * Go to the **Assignments** tab, select **groups**, and **remove all the groups** (remember these group names).
  * Wait until the users are removed from the Smallstep console (a few seconds).
  * Then re-add the groups using the **assign** button.
  * This will trigger a push, and you will see the new uid and gid values in the Smallstep console.

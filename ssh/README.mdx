Smallstep SSH is a commercial product that delivers a complete end-to-end SSH
workflow combining the benefits of modern identity providers, SSH certificates,
and proven standard technologies like OpenSSH and OAuth. The Professional
Edition is a managed offering that takes the open source `step-ca` and adds
automatic access control, end-to-end user lifecycle management, event activity
logging, and reporting.

## Step 1: Set up your client

Start by configuring SSH access on your laptop:

identity provider. Note: Single Sign-on through your identity provider requires
SSH Professional + Team level account or higher. [Click here for more pricing

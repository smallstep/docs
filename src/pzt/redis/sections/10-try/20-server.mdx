You can test your certificate by starting up Redis with TLS enabled.

<Alert severity="warning">
  Native "SSL Support" (TLS) was added to Redis 6.0.0, which was released GA on
  April 30, 2020. TLS in Redis is an <strong>optional feature</strong> and not
  all Redis server binaries will have it enabled. The official Docker image, and
  many OS distribution images, have TLS enabled.
</Alert>

```shell
redis-server \
	--tls-port 6379 --port 0 \
	--tls-cert-file /path/to/server.crt \
	--tls-key-file /path/to/server.key \
	--tls-ca-cert-file /path/to/ca.crt \
	--tls-auth-clients no
```

- `6379` is the default port that `redis-cli` (and probably SDKs) connect to.
- Setting `--port 0` disables the non-TLS TCP socket.
- `--tls-auth-client no` disables client authentication (which is on by default).
- The server's private key can be password-protected using PEM encryption.
  Use `step crypto change-pass` to encrypt the private key.
  Then, the server will prompt for the password at startup, or you can provide it using `--tls-key-file-pass <password>`.

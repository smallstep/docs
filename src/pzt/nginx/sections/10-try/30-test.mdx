To make sure Nginx is presenting a valid certificate, you can use the `curl` command, passing it your root certificate for use in verifying the server.

<CodeBlock

  copyText="curl --cacert ca.crt https://myserver.example.net"

  {`$ curl --cacert ca.crt https://myserver.example.net
HTTP/2 200

</CodeBlock>

Now that your certificate is issued (and kept updated)
in the `myserver-tls` secret, you'll need to configure Nginx
to actually use that certificate.

In the "Try It" section above, we showed how to configure
a standalone Nginx server to use a certificate and private key.
However, in Kubernetes, it's much more common to have Nginx
deployed as an ingress controller.

For this example, we will assume that you already
have <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/">ingress-nginx</a>
deployed into your cluster. In that case, telling your ingress
to make use of the certificate and private key in the `myserver-tls` secret
is as easy as adding a `tls` block to your exsting `Ingress` resource.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myserver
  labels: ...
  annotations: ...
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myserver.example.net
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: my-service
              servicePort: 5000
            path: /
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - myserver.company.net
      secretName: myserver-tls
```

Voila! ingress-nginx will pick up this `tls` configuration
and automatically serve the renewed certificate each time
the `myserver-tls` secret is updated.

As in the section above, you can test your configuration
using `curl` and your CA root certificate.

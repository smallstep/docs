You'll also notice the above `Certificate` resource has an `issuerRef`
specifying a cert-manager `Issuer` resource named `my-ca`.
Before cert-manager knows how to use your CA
to issue and renew your certificate, we'll need to create
that `Issuer` resource and configure it to point
to your private ACME CA (or RA if you've configured one).
Create `my-ca-issuer.yaml` and fill in the CA URL with your own.
The `Issuer` will keep an account key in a Kubernetes secret
which is configurable here as well.

<CodeBlock autoCopy language="yaml">
  {`apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: my-ca
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://my-ca-url.my-team.ca.smallstep.com/acme/acme/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: my-ca-account-key
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: ${props.pzt.kubernetes.ingressClass}`}
</CodeBlock>

Then apply:

```shell
kubectl apply -f my-ca-issuer.yaml
```

<p>
  To verify that the requester of the certificate actually controls the DNS name
  specified in your ACME request (from <inlineCode>dnsName</inlineCode> in your{' '}
  <inlineCode>Certificate</inlineCode>), the ACME CA will send an HTTP challenge
  request to that DNS name and expects to receive particular response. For this
  reason, your Kubernetes cluster must have some HTTP ingress configured, and
  your DNS name must resolve to that ingress. In the above example, we assume
  your ingress has a class name{' '}
  <inlineCode>{props.pzt.kubernetes.ingressClass}</inlineCode>, and cert-manager
  will automatically intercept ACME requests to that ingress to solve the HTTP01
  ACME challenge sent by your CA. This effectively "authenticates" your ACME
  client with the CA, and the CA will then sign the certificate.
</p>

<p>
  If all went as expected now that both your{' '}
  <inlineCode>Certificate</inlineCode> and your <inlineCode>Issuer</inlineCode>{' '}
  are configured, cert-manager should have issued (or begun issuing) the
  certificate and created the{' '}
  <inlineCode>{props.pzt.server.name}-tls</inlineCode> secret with your
  certificate and private key. We'll reference this secret later when we
  configure {props.pzt.name} to use this certificate and private key for TLS.
</p>

<Aside>
<p>
  If you prefer to use the DNS01 ACME challenge—which proves that you control
  the domain by updating a DNS record rather than resolving an HTTP request—your
  cert-manager <inlineCode>Issuer</inlineCode> can be configured as follows.
  This could be useful if you do not have any ingress to your cluster or
  otherwise are unable to resolve HTTP requests to your specified DNS name.

  The example above is configured for Google Cloud DNS, but you can refer to the{' '}
  <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/">
    cert-manager DNS01 documentation
  </a>{' '}
  for specifics on how to configure your DNS provider. cert-manager will
  automatically handle updating your DNS zone to respond to ACME challenges from
  your CA.

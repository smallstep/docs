  Now that your certificate is issued (and kept updated) in the{' '}
  <inlineCode>{props.pzt.server.name}-tls</inlineCode> secret, you'll need to
  configure your {props.pzt.name} deployment to mount that secret to disk, then
  to reload the certificate (or restart its process) each time the certificate
  is updated on disk. We haven't yet investigated the specifics for{' '}
  {props.pzt.name}. Refer to the {props.pzt.name} documentation for more
  details, and feel free to{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/smallstep/practicalzt">contribute this content</a>{' '}
  directly on GitHub.

Smallstep CAs use _provisioners_ to authenticate certificate requests using passwords, one-time tokens, single sign-on, and a variety of other mechanisms.

- **ACME** ([RFC8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555)) is an open standard, used by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), for authenticating certificate requests. To use ACME on a private network you need to run an ACME server. ACME is harder to setup, but has a [large client ecosystem](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients) (some software even has built-in support).
- **Other provisioners** use the open source [`step` CLI](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli) and do not require a local network agent. The instructions below focus on the JWK provisioner, but can be repurposed with small tweaks to operationalize all non-ACME provisioners.

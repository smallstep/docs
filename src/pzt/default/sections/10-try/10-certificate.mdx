<p>
  Before you can configure {props.pzt.name} TLS, you will need a certificate
  issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). If you already have a
  certificate, private key, and CA root certificate from your organization's
  existing CA, you can skip to the {props.pzt.name} TLS configuration section
  below. If you need to generate a certificate, you can:

  This tutorial is designed for private networks, not publicly trusted websites
  or endpoints. If you are looking to automate certificates for public websites,
  servers, or endpoints, we recommend using{' '}

  below.

  To request a certificate from your CA using the{' '}
  <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli">
    <inlineCode>step</inlineCode>
  </a>{' '}
  CLI, bootstrap your CA with <inlineCode>step ca bootstrap</inlineCode> and run
  the following command (sub the server name for the actual name / DNS name of
  your {props.pzt.name} server).

Your certificate and private key will be saved in `server.crt` and `server.key` respectively.

Request a copy of your CA root certificate, which will be used to make
sure each application can trust certificates presented by other
applications.

```shell
step ca root ca.crt
```

Your certificate will be saved in `ca.crt`.

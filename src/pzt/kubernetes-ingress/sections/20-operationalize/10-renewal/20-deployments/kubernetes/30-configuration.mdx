Telling your ingress to make use of the certificate and private key
in the `myserver-tls` secret is as easy as adding a `tls` block
to your exsting `Ingress` resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myserver
  labels: ...
  annotations: ...
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myserver.example.net
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: my-service
              servicePort: 5000
            path: /
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - myserver.company.net
      secretName: myserver-tls
```

Voila! Your ingress controller will pick up this `tls` configuration
and automatically serve the renewed certificate each time
the `myserver-tls` secret is updated.

Use `curl` to check that your TLS configuraiton is working as expected.
You'll need to pass your CA root certificate as an argument
so `curl` can verify the ingress certificate.

  Before you can configure Kubernetes Ingress TLS, you will need to be able to
  request a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). If you
  already have a private CA and root certificate, you can skip to the automated
  renewal section below. If you need to create a CA, you can:

  <li>
    Roll your own with{' '}

</ul>

<Alert severity="warning">
  This tutorial is designed for private networks, not publicly trusted websites
  or endpoints. If you are looking to automate certificates for public websites,
  servers, or endpoints, we recommend using{' '}
  <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> and the ACME instructions
  below.
</Alert>

Request a copy of your CA root certificate, which will be used to make
sure each application can trust certificates presented by other
applications.

```shell
step ca root ca.crt
```

Your certificate will be saved in `ca.crt`.

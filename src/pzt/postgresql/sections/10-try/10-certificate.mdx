  Before you can configure {props.pzt.name} TLS, you will need a certificate
  issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). If you already have a

  This tutorial is designed for private networks, not publicly trusted websites
  or endpoints. If you are looking to automate certificates for public websites,
  servers, or endpoints, we recommend using{' '}

  below.

  To request a certificate from your CA using the{' '}
  <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli">

  </a>{' '}
  CLI, bootstrap your CA with <inlineCode>step ca bootstrap</inlineCode> and run
  the following command (sub the server name for the actual name / DNS name of
  your {props.pzt.name} server).

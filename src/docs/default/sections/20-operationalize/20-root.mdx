    <p>
      Once {name} TLS is configured, you'll need to make sure that clients know
      to trust certificates signed by your CA. For certificates signed by a
      public CA (like Let's Encrypt), most clients already include the CA root
      certificate in their trust stores for certificate verification. But, for a
      private CA, you will need to explicitly add your CA's root certificate to
      your clients' trust stores.

  )}

The `step` CLI includes a utility command for this purpose on many systems:

```shell
step certificate install ca.crt
```

Rather than manually running the above for each machine that needs
to trust your CA, most teams will use some form of automation
to distribute the root certificate. Depending on your needs
and your IT or DevOps team's approach, this may be
a configuration management tool (like Ansible or Puppet),
a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution,
or something else. Some examples:

- Use Ansible to add `ca.crt` directly to the `ca-ceritficates` bundle on linux VMs so running applications trust the API servers they call
- Bake `ca.crt` directly into base Docker images for gRPC so gRPC clients can always reference the trusted CA
- Store `ca.crt` in a Kubernetes `Secret` and inject it into an environment variable for access from application code
- Use Jamf to install `ca.crt` in the trust stores of every employee Macbook so their web browsers trust internal websites
- Use Puppet to run `step certificate install ca.crt` on target machines that want `curl` to implicity trust the CA
- Store `ca.crt` in a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` and mount it to pods for reference on the filesystem

Alternatively, many clients support passing the CA root certificate as a flag or argument at runtime.

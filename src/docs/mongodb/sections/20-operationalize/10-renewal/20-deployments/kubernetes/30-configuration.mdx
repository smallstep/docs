Now that your certificate is issued (and kept updated)
in the `redis-tls` secret, you'll need to configure Redis
to actually use that certificate.

For this example, we will show how to configure Redis
using the
[`bitnami/redis`](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis)
Helm chart. There are numerous ways to deploy Redis in Kuberenetes,
and you're welcome to repurpose these instructions for other approaches,
but the `bitnami/redis` chart has built-in support
for reloading certificates when their corresponding secret changes.

Assuming you already have `bitnami/redis` deployed to your cluster,
TLS configuration can be handled entirely through Helm values:

```yaml
# ...
tls:
  enabled: true
  existingSecret: redis-tls
# ...
```

Use `helm upgrade` to re-deploy (or install) your chart,
and Redis TLS will then always use your latest certificate
from the `redis-tls` secret.

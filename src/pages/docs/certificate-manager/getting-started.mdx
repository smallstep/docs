Smallstep Certificate Manager is a commercial product that delivers a managed certificate authority (CA) capable of issuing private x.509 TLS or SSH certificates. 
Certificate Manager builds on two open source projects, maintained by smallstep:
* `step-ca`: a private online certificate authority for secure automated certificate management.
* `step`: a general-purpose cryptography toolkit and the client-side counterpart to step-ca.
With Certificate Manager, you can create your own private CA to manage certificates on internal services, websites, infrastructure, people, or devices.

Before you begin.
1. [register for a smallstep account](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=cm) if you haven't already.
2. [Install `step`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation), which will be used to manage access to, and get certificates from, an authority.  

### step 1 - create an Authority
Certificate Manager authorities are trusted services that manage certificate issuance and revocation.
In this tutorial, we will create a hosted authority, an online CA that authenticates and authorizes certificate requests and issues certificates.
 
* Log into the smallstep dashboard, select the Certificate Manager tab, and click the "Add Authority" button.
* Choose "Create a new hosted authority"
* Give your Authority a name and subdomain value (the URL path you wish to use for your online CA).
* Choose "Create"

Behind the scenes, Certificate Manager creates a new root and an online intermediate CA,
storing the private keys into Google's [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management).
On the Authority detail page, you will see the CA URL and Fingerprint;
you'll use these values to interact with your CA.

Certificate Manager also creates a default provisioner called 'authority-admin',
and a "super admin" account on that provisioner,
with your email address as the account name. 
The super admin can manage admins and provisioners on your Authority.

### step 2 - configure your client

Certificate Manager authorities are administered using the `step` command-line client. 
To connect your local client with the hosted authority, you need to bootstrap into the PKI. 
Run the following command, substituting the values from your Authority's properties:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca bootstrap --ca-url [YOUR CA URL] --fingerprint [YOUR AUTHORITY FINGERPRINT]">
{`$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url [YOUR CA URL] --fingerprint [YOUR AUTHORITY FINGERPRINT]
`}
</CodeBlock>

(You can always find this command on the Quick Actions section on your authority page.)
This command will download the CA Root certificate and configure your local client to interact with the Authority.

### step 3 - Create a test certificate

With an authority created and your local client configured,
you can create a test certificate by running the `step ca certificate` command.
Here is an example:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca certificate myservice myservice.crt myservice.key --san myservice.internal.mycompany.net --not-after 24h">
  {`$ step ca certificate myservice myservice.crt myservice.key --san myservice.internal.mycompany.net --not-after 24h`}
</CodeBlock>

In this command, we are asking the CA to create a certificate with the following properties
* `myservice` - The name on the certificate
* `myservice.crt` - Store the certificate in a file with this name
* `myservice.key` - Store the key in a file with this name
* `--san myservice.internal.mycompany.net` - Add an additional SAN to the certificate with the specified value
* `--not-after 24h` - Set the certificate to expire after 24 hours.

When you run this command, it will envoke the 'authority-admin' provisioner and start a single sign-on flow via the smallstep dashboard.
After a successful sign-in, the authority will issue the certificate. 
You can inspect your certificate by running:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt">
  {`$ step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt`}
</CodeBlock>

It should look similar to this.

```shell
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2441...2018]
  Subject:     98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda
               admin@yourco.com
               https://auth.smallstep.com#98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda
  Issuer:      provisioner test Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: authority-admin [ID: 909d...8521]
  Valid from:  2021-10-04T21:30:12Z
          to:  2021-10-05T21:31:12Z
```

### step 4 - renew a certificate
Certificates expire. 
Certificate Manager makes renewing a certificate ahead of expiration easy. 
Renewals are authenticated using your existing certificate, and produce an identical certificate with a new serial number and extended lifetime.
The private key is unchanged.

In its most primitive form, renewal is a simple single-command operation:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca renew svc.crt svc.key">
  {`$ step ca renew svc.crt svc.key`}
</CodeBlock>

More than a dozen command-line flags make [`step ca renew`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/renew) flexible and easy to integrate into almost any operational environment.

That's it. 
You've now created an authority, issued a certificate, and renewed a certificate. These three actions are the foundation of your certificate management experience. 

## Next Steps

Some common next steps include:
*  Remove the human interactions and [automate certificate renewal](/docs/step-ca/certificate-authority-server-production#automated-renewal).
*  Start using a password, one-time token, cloud VM API, or other mechanism to [operationalize getting certificates](/docs/certificate-manager/how-it-works#provisioners).
*  Modify and automate custom certificate attributues using [certificate templates](/docs/step-ca/templates).
*  Create your own [private ACME server](/docs/certificate-manager/acme).
*  Talk with the [smallstep technical team](https://smallstep.com/request-demo).

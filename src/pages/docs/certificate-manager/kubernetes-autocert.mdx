Autocert exists to make it easy to use mutual TLS to improve security within a cluster and to secure communication into, out of, and between Kubernetes clusters. 
To get a certificate you simply need to telll autocert your workload's name, using the `autocert.step.sm/name`pod annotation. 
Autocert will issue a cert to the pod, make it available in `var/run/autocert.step.sm`, and keep it renewed. 
It requires a certificate authority to issue certificates. 
This guide shows how to configure autocert to use Certificate Manager as the upstream CA.

## Before you begin

You will need:

* An account on the Smallstep platform. Need one? [Register here](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=cm)
* An Authority in Certificate Manager that will act as your upstream CA

## Bootstrap with your CA

Bootstrapping with your Authority configures your workstation to trust the authority's root certificate.

Run:

```bash
step ca bootstrap --ca-url [your CA URL] \
    --fingerprint [your CA fingerprint] \
	--install
```

## Add a provisioner

Autocert requires a JWK provisioner (it's the default type).
Let's call it `autocert`. Run:

```bash
step ca provisioner add autocert --create
```

You’ll be asked to provide a password to encrypt the provisioner private key.

## Create ConfigMaps and a Secret for Autocert

In Kubernetes, create a namespace for autocert:

```bash
kubectl create ns step
```

Output:

```bash
namespace/step created
```

Use the same password you entered when creating the provisioner to create the Secret.

```bash
kubectl -n step create secret generic autocert-password --from-file=password=autocert-password.txt
```

Output:

```bash
secret/autocert-password created
```

Now create a `ConfigMap` that includes your (bootstrapped) config dir:

```bash
kubectl -n step create configmap config --from-file $(step path)/config`
```

Output:

```bash
configmap/config created
```

We'll do the same thing for the `certs` dir, which contains our CA's root certificate:

```bash
kubectl -n step create configmap certs --from-file $(step path)/certs
```

Output:

```bash
configmap/certs created
```

## Deploy Autocert

1. Download the yaml config:

  ```bash
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smallstep/autocert/master/install/02-autocert.yaml
  ```

2. Edit the `caUrl` in the `autocert-config` ConfigMap in the `02-autocert.yaml` file you just downloaded. Change it from `https://ca.step.svc.cluster.local` to your Certificate Manager authority URL, e.g. `https://autocert.areed.ca.smallstep.com`.

3. Run:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smallstep/autocert/master/install/03-rbac.yaml
  ```

  Output:
  
  ```bash
  clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/autocert-controller created
  clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/autocert-controller created
  ```

4. Now let's deploy autocert. Run:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f 02-autocert.yaml
   ```
   
   Output:
   
   ```bash
   service/autocert created
   configmap/autocert-config created
   deployment.apps/autocert created
   ```

5. And, let's deploy the admission webhook:

  You can see in this block that we're including the root CA certificate (in base64) as part of the client configuration for autocert.

  ```bash
  cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
  apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
  kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
  metadata:
    name: autocert-webhook-config
    labels: {app: autocert}
  webhooks:
    - name: autocert.step.sm
      sideEffects: None
      admissionReviewVersions: ["v1beta1"]
      clientConfig:
        service:
          name: autocert
          namespace: step
          path: "/mutate"
        caBundle: $(cat $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n')
      rules:
        - operations: ["CREATE"]
          apiGroups: [""]
          apiVersions: ["v1"]
          resources: ["pods"]
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          autocert.step.sm: enabled
  EOF
  ```
  
  output:
  
  ```jsx
  mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/autocert-webhook-config created
  ```

Autocert is now added to the cluster and configured.
You can run this command to verify the autocert pods are marked Ready.

```bash
kubectl -n step get deployment/autocert
```

## Usage

Let’s create a test app that will use autocert. 
It’s a “Hello World” web server that uses mutual TLS authentication.

Since this deployment is in the default namespace, label it to tell autocert to issue and renew certificates for new pods with the `autocert.step.sm/name` annotation:

```bash
kubectl label namespace default autocert.step.sm=enabled
```

Output:

```bash
namespace/default labeled
```

To test things out, we'll create a deployment with the `autocert.step.sm/name` pod annotation.
This example uses the name `localhost`, since we will be testing from our workstation.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hello-mtls
  name: hello-mtls
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-mtls
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autocert.step.sm/name: localhost
      labels:
        app: hello-mtls
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: smallstep/hello-mtls-server-go:latest
        name: hello-mtls
EOF
```

Output:

```bash
deployment.apps/hello-mtls created
```

For testing, forward `localhost:8443` to port 443 on the pod.

```
kubectl port-forward deploy/hello-mtls 8443:443
```

Output:

```bash
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8443 -> 443
Forwarding from [::1]:8443 -> 443
```

Keep this running in the background during the next steps.

Now issue a client certificate signed by your CA. 
You’ll need this to authenticate to the “Hello mTLS” test server.

```bash
step ca certificate andrew@smallstep.com areed.crt areed.key
```

Finally, you should be able to verify it's all working:

```bash
curl --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
     --cert areed.crt --key areed.key \
     https://localhost:8443
```

Output:

```bash
Hello andrew@smallstep.com!
```

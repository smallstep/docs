`step-ca` is built for robust certificate management in distributed systems. As
with any entity in your infrastructure, running `step-ca` effectively in
production requires some knowledge of its strengths and limitations. This
document addresses the important production considerations that operators
should know about when running `step-ca` as a certificate authority server.

## Good Security Practices

In this section we recommend a few best practices when it comes to running, deploying, and managing your own online certificate authority server and PKI.
Security is a moving target.
We expect our recommendations to change and evolve as well.

### Safeguard Your Root And Intermediate CA Keys

When you initialize a two-tier CA, two private keys are generated:
one intermediate private key, and one root private key.
It is very important that these private keys be kept secret.

The intermediate key is used by the CA to sign certificates. The root key is not needed for day-to-day CA operation and should be stored offline.
The keys can be generated on an air-gapped device or on a Hardware Security Module (HSM).

Here's an example key protection strategy for a high-security production PKI.

In this example, `step-ca` acts as a subordinate CA to an offline root CA.

1. Generate a root CA (private key and certificate) on a [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module) or air-gapped device that is kept in "cold storage", off the internet.
HSMs are ideal for storing private keys and performing signing operations securely.
For durability, keep at least two copies of your root key, in separate locations.
2. Generate intermediate key(s) on a separate, online cloud HSM or in a key management service (KMS) that will be used by the CA for signing operations in production
3. Generate Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) for your intermediate CA(s)
4. Sign the generated CSR using the root HSM
5. Configure `step-ca` to use the signed root and intermediate certificates
6. Configure `step-ca` to access the cloud HSM or KMS intermediate key for online signing operations

See the [Cryptographic Protection](/docs/step-ca/configuration#cryptographic-protection) section of our [Configuration Guide](/docs/step-ca/configuration) to learn more about your options for using HSMs or cloud KMS with `step-ca`.

### Use Strong Passwords and Store Them Well

When you [initialize your PKI](/docs/step-ca/getting-started/#initialize-your-certificate-authority),
the root and intermediate private keys will be encrypted with the same password.

Use a password manager to generate random passwords, 
or let [`step ca init`](/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/init) generate a strong password for you.

After initializing your CA, 
we recommend that you immediately change the password for the intermediate CA private key:

```shell
step crypto change-pass $(step path)/secrets/intermediate_ca_key
```

You'll use this new intermediate key password to start `step-ca`.

<Alert severity="info">
  <AlertTitle>Never use your password in a command line argument.</AlertTitle>
  <div>
    To keep sensitive values from leaking into <Code>.bash_history</Code> and system state, put
    your intermediate key password into a file by itself. Then use the
    <Code>--password-file</Code> flag when calling <Code>step-ca</Code>.
  </div>
</Alert>

Once you've changed the intermediate private key password, 
you should never have to use the root private key password again. 
So, then what should you do with it?

Bury it in a cave high in the mountains.

Or, store it in a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers) or secrets manager. 
There are many to choose from and the choice will depend on the risk & security profile of your organization.

In addition to using a password manager to store all passwords 
(private key, provisioner password, etc.) we recommend using a threshold cryptography algorithm like
[Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing)
to divide the root private key password across a handful of trusted parties.

### Avoid Storing Passwords in Environment Variables

`systemd` discourages using the environment for secrets 
because it doesn't consider it secure and exposes a unit's environment over dbus. From 
[systemd.exec(5)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html#ENVIRONMENT):

> Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as passwords, key material, â€¦) to service processes. 
> Environment variables set for a unit are exposed to unprivileged clients via D-Bus IPC, and generally not understood as being data that requires protection. 
> Moreover, environment variables are propagated down the process tree, 
> including across security boundaries (such as setuid/setgid executables), 
> and hence might leak to processes that should not have access to the secret data.

For some isolated environments, we could see an argument for the convenience of an environment variable.
Even then, there can be subtle issues.
For example, anyone with access to the Docker daemon can view all of the environment variables of running Docker containers, using `docker inspect`.

For posterity, however, if you've secured your environment and rely on it for secrets, there is a way to pass a password into `step-ca` from an environment variable in Bash:

```shell
step-ca --password-file <(echo -n "$STEP_CA_PASSWORD") $(step path)/config/ca.json
```

This method is known as [Bash Process Subsitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html),
and on most systems the password will not appear in `ps` output.
However, **this approach is not recommended** simply because it's so difficult to ensure security with environment variables.

See our blog <a href="/blog/command-line-secrets/">How to Handle Secrets on the Command Line</a> for an in-depth exploration of this topic.

### Replace Your Default Provisioner

When you [initialize your PKI](/docs/step-ca/getting-started/#initialize-your-certificate-authority),
a default `JWK` provisioner will be created.
If you're not going to use this provisioner,
we recommend deleting it.

If you _are_ going to use this provisioner,
secure it with a different password than your CA's signing keys.
You can do this by passing separate `--password-file` and `--provisioner-password-file` files when running `step ca init`.

See the section on [managing provisioners](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#provisioner-management).

### Use Short-Lived Certificates

We recommend the following:
- User certificates should have the lifespan of a mayfly: about a day or less[^1].
- Host or service account certificates should have a lifetime of one month or less.

Certificates from `step-ca` expire in 24 hours by default.
We made it easy for you to [automate the renewal of your certificates](/docs/step-ca/renewal) using the `step` command.
Carpe diem!

You can [configure certificate lifetimes](/docs/step-ca/configuration#basic-configuration-options) in the `ca.json` file. 

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    Short-lived certificates are not a replacement for active revocation using certificate revocation lists (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).
	Automatic active revocation is not available in <Code>step-ca</Code>, but you can manually manage a CRL for your CA certificates. See below.
  </div>
</Alert>


<Footnote id="fn-1" marker="1">
One mayfly species, <i>dolania americana</i>, lives for five minutes or less!
So do some certificates.
But it can be difficult to operationalize such short-lived certificates.
</Footnote>

### Enable Active Revocation On Your Intermediate CA

The value of a two-tiered PKI is that you can add your root CA certificate to the certificate trust store on all of your nodes, and store your root private key completely offline.
A leaf certificate signed by the CA always comes in a bundle that contains the intermediate CA certificate alongside the leaf certificate.
With this bundle, any client that trusts your root CA can verify the complete chain of trust.

Now, what if one day your intermediate CA key is compromised?
You could issue a new intermediate using your root CA key, but your old intermediate has a 10 year validity period!
So, you're stuck having to rotate your root CA too, and that's a much bigger project because you have to distribute the new root certificate to everyone and ensure the old one is no longer trusted.
To avoid this scenario, you can use _active revocation_ on your intermediate CA certificate,
making it possible to immediately revoke a compromised intermediate.

While `step-ca` doesn't directly support active revocation mechanisms like Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or the Online Certificate Status Portocol (OCSP),
you can independently manage your own CRL if you like.

#### Create an intermediate CA with a CRL distribution endpoint

Let's make it possible to revoke your intermediate CA down the road if necessary.
This setup is more complex than the default `step-ca` PKI, but it offers an insurance policy for a compromised intermediate CA.

1. Create an intermediate CA that includes a CRL endpoint. Save the following template to `intermediate.tpl`:

  ```json
  {
          "subject": {{ toJson .Subject }},
          "keyUsage": ["certSign", "crlSign"],
          "basicConstraints": {
                  "isCA": true,
                  "maxPathLen": 0
          },
          "crlDistributionPoints":
                  ["http://crl.example.com/crl/ca.crl"]
          }
  }
  ```

  You'll need this template to manually create your intermediate CA.
  The CRL endpoint here should be an HTTP URL; the CRL file itself is signed.
  The CRL will be a static file, so you you might choose an object storage or CDN endpoint here.
  
  Use the template to create your intermediate CA. You will need your root CA certificate and key:
  
  ```bash
  $ step certificate create "Example Intermediate CA" \
       $(step path)/certs/intermediate_ca.crt \
       $(step path)/secrets/intermediate_ca_key \
       --template intermediate.tpl \
       --ca $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
       --ca-key $(step path)/secrets/root_ca_key \
       --not-after 87660h
  ```

2. Create an empty CRL file and sign it with your root CA key:

  ```bash
  cat <<EOF > openssl.conf
  [ ca ]
  default_ca = CA_default
  
  [ CA_default ]
  default_crl_days = 30
  database = index.txt
  default_md = sha256
  EOF
  touch index.txt
  openssl ca \
      -config openssl.conf \
      -gencrl \
      -keyfile $(step path)/secrets/root_ca_key \
      -cert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
      -out ca.crl.pem
  openssl crl \
      -inform PEM \
      -in ca.crl.pem \
      -outform DER \
      -out ca.crl
  ```

3. Upload the DER-formatted `ca.crl` file to the distribution point URL you specified in the template.
4. Finally, configure your `step-ca` server to use the intermediate CA you created.


<Alert severity="warning">
  <div>
	Your CRL will expire, so you will need to generate and push a new empty CRL file regularly. We recommend updating the CRL once two-thirds of its lifetime has elapsed. Configuring automated CRL renewal is beyond the scope of this document.
  </div>
</Alert>

#### Revoke A Certificate

To revoke a certificate, add it to the `index.txt` file before regenerating the CRL file. The format for this CRL database file is:

- One certificate per line
- Each line is tab-delimited
- The tab-delimited fields are:
  1. **Entry type.** May be `V` (valid), `R` (revoked) or `E` (expired).
      An expired certificate may have the type `V` because the type has not been updated.
	  `openssl ca updatedb` does such an update.
  2. **Expiration datetime.** Format is `yymmddHHMMSSZ`.
  3. **Revokation datetime** and **optional revocation reason**. Must be set for any entry of the type `R`. Format is `yymmddHHMMSSZ[,reason]`.
  4. **Certificate serial number** in uppercase hexidecimal, eg. `804A72D941DB451A0123BA4706446D1F`.
  5. **File name** This doesn't seem to be used, ever, so use the value `unknown`.
  6. **Certificate subject** eg. `CN=Test Intermediate CA,O=Smallstep Labs\, Inc`

### Use Templates With Care

Because certificate templates add a lot of flexibility to `step-ca`,
they can be a source of subtle vulnerabilities in your PKI.
If you use [custom certificate templates](/docs/step-ca/templates), be sure they are tightly restricted for your use case.
Use extreme caution when referencing user-supplied data marked as `Insecure` in templates.

### Create a Service User to Run `step-ca`

Make sure that the configuration folders, private keys, and password file used by the CA are _only_
accessible by this user. If you're running `step-ca` on port 443, you'll need the `step-ca` binary
to be able to bind to that port. See [Running `step-ca` as a Daemon](#running-step-ca-as-a-daemon) for details.

## Running `step-ca` as a Daemon

This section makes the following assumptions:
- GNU/Linux OS is running systemd version 245 or greater.
- [CA has been initialized](/docs/step-ca/getting-started#initialize-your-certificate-authority).

1. Add a service user for the CA.

  <CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="sudo useradd --system --home /etc/step-ca --shell /bin/false step">
  {`$ sudo useradd --system --home /etc/step-ca --shell /bin/false step`}
  </CodeBlock>

  If your CA will bind to port 443, the `step-ca` binary will need to be
  given low port-binding capabilities:

  <CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip $(which step-ca)">
  {`$ sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip $(which step-ca)`}
  </CodeBlock>

2. Move your CA configuration into a system-wide location.

  <CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="sudo mv $(step path) /etc/step-ca">
  {`$ sudo mv $(step path) /etc/step-ca`}
  </CodeBlock>

  Make sure your CA password is located in `/etc/step-ca/password.txt`,
  so that it can be read upon server startup.

  You'll also need to edit the following files to reflect the new path:
  - `/etc/step-ca/config/defaults.json`
  - `/etc/step-ca/config/ca.json`

  Set the `step` user as the owner of your CA configuration directory:

  <CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="sudo chown -R step:step /etc/step-ca">
  {`$ sudo chown -R step:step /etc/step-ca`}
  </CodeBlock>

3. Create a `systemd` unit file.

  ```shell-session
  $ sudo wget https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/systemd/step-ca.service -O /etc/systemd/system/step-ca.service
  ```

   Here are some notes on the security properties in this file:
   * `User` and `Group` cause `step-ca` to run as a non-privileged user.
   * `AmbientCapabilities` allows the process to receive ambient capabilities.
    `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` allows the process to bind to ports < 1024. See [capabiliites(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).
   * `CapabilityBoundingSet` limits the set of capabilities the process can have.
   * `SecureBits` allows the service to keep its capabilities even after switching to the `step` user.
   * `NoNewPrivileges` ensures no future privilege escalation by the process.
   * `ProtectSystem` and `ProtectHome` configure sandboxing via a read-only file system namespace dedicated to the process.
   * `ProtectNamespaces` prevents the process from creating kernel namespaces.
   * `RestrictAddressFamilies` prevents the service from allocating esoteric sockets such as `AF_PACKET`.
   * `PrivateTmp` gives the service its own private `/tmp`.
   * `PrivateDevices` presents a very limited `/dev` to the service.
   * `Protect*` limits access to system resources.
   * `LockPersonality` locks the process's execution domain.
   * `RestrictSUIDSGID` restricts setuid/setgid file creation.
   * `RemoveIPC` removes any IPC objects created by the service when it is stopped.
   * `RestrictRealtime` restricts real-time scheduling access.
   * `SystemCallFilter` defines an allow list of system calls the service can use.
   * `SystemCallArchitectures` restricts the service to only be able to call native system calls.
   * `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` prevents the service from creating writable-executable memory mappings.
   * `ReadWriteDirectories` ensures that the process can write its state directories.

   See [systemd.exec(5)](https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html), [systemd.unit(5)](https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#),
   and [systemd.service(5)](https://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#) for more details.

4. Enable and start the service.

  The following are a few useful commands for
  checking the status of your CA,
  enabling it on system startup,
  and starting your CA.

  ```shell-session nocopy
  # Rescan the systemd unit files
  $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

  # Check the current status of the step-ca service
  $ sudo systemctl status step-ca

  # Enable and start the `step-ca` process
  $ systemctl enable --now step-ca

  # Follow the log messages for step-ca
  $ journalctl --follow --unit=step-ca
  ```

## High Availability

<Alert severity="warning">
  <div> 
    <Code>step-ca</Code> is built to scale horizontally. However, the creators
    and maintainers do not regularly test in an HA environment using multiple
    instances. You may run into issues we did not plan for. If this happens, please
    <Link href="https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/issues"> open an issue</Link>.
  </div>
</Alert>

A few things to consider / implement when running multiple instances of `step-ca`:

- **Use a MySQL database.** The default Badger database has no concurrency support.
  The only integrated DB that can support multiple instances is MySQL.
  See the [database documentation][db-ref] to learn how to configure `step-ca` for MySQL.
- **Respect concurrency limits.** The ACME server has known concurrency limitations when using the same account to
  manage multiple orders. The recommended temporary workaround is to generate
  an ephemeral account keypair for each new ACME order, or to ensure that ACME
  orders owned by the same account are managed serially. The issue tracking
  this limitation can be found [here](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/issues/341).
- **Synchronize `ca.json` across instances.** `step-ca` reads all of it's
  configuration (and all of the provisioner configuration) from the `ca.json` file
  specified on the command line. If the `ca.json` of one instance is modified
  (either manually or using a command like `step ca provisioner (add | remove)`)
  the other instances will not pick up on this change until the `ca.json` is
  copied over to the correct location for each instance and the instance is 
  sent `SIGHUP` or restarted. It's recommended to use a configuration management
  tool (ansible, chef, salt, puppet, etc.) to synchronize `ca.json` across instances.

[db-ref]: /docs/step-ca/configuration#databases

## Load balancing or proxying `step-ca` traffic

If you need to place a load balancer or reverse proxy downstream from the CA, we recommend using layer 4 (TCP)
load balancing or proxying (aka "TLS passthrough").

We also recommend enabling [remote provisioner management](/docs/step-ca/provisioners/#remote-provisioner-management) so that your provisioner configuration can be shared by all `step-ca` instances.

Layer 7 proxying is _not recommended_, becase the `step` toolchain is built around TLS:
- `step` expects to be able to perform a TLS handshake with `step-ca`, using the CA's root certificate
  to complete the trust chain.
- Certificate renewal uses mutual TLS by default.
  `step-ca` authenticates the client using the expiring certificate, in order to issue a new one.
  Mutual TLS requires a direct, end-to-end TLS handshake between `step` and `step-ca`.
  (See `step ca renew --help` for more details.)
- By design, `step-ca` does not have an option to run in HTTP only.
  Philosophically, we value perimeterless security and we believe people should use authenticated encryption (e.g. mutual TLS) everywhere.
  Making mTLS easy, and helping people get away from the "perimeter security" anti-pattern, are motivating goals behind the project.

  That said, lots of folks have legacy issues to contend with, some of these decisions are out of their control, and every threat model is different.
  See [certificates#246](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/issues/246) for more details.

### Further Reading

- Nginx has a [stream module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html) that allows it to pass TLS traffic directly to `step-ca`.
  But it comes with a price: Unlike typical reverse proxy configurations, source IPs are not visible to `step-ca` (there is no `X-Forwarded-For` header), and traffic is also not logged to the nginx access log.
  See [this blog post](https://fedingo.com/how-to-configure-ssl-tls-passthrough-in-nginx/) for an example of TLS passthrough.
- Caddy doesn't natively support TLS passthrough, but there is an experimental [`caddy-l4`](https://github.com/mholt/caddy-l4) module that can do it.

## Automate X.509 Certificate Lifecycle Management

We recommend automating certificate renewal when possible.
Renewal can be easily automated in many environments.
See our [Renewal](/docs/step-ca/renewal) documentation for details.

## X.509 Certificate Revocation

By default, `step-ca` uses passive revocation.
Certificates can be revoked using the `step ca revoke` subcommand.
See our [Revocation](/docs/step-ca/revocation) documentation for details.

## Sane Cryptographic Defaults

The `step` ecosystem uses sane defaults so that you don't have to be a security
engineer to use our `step-ca` safely. Our defaults align with best current
practices in the industry for using cryptographic primitives and higher order
abstractions, like JWTs.

This section describes our defaults and explains the rationale behind them. Our
selections and guidance will change and evolve over time as security and
cryptography are constantly changing in response to real world pressures.

### Tokens

We use JWTs ([JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)) to prove authenticity and identity within the `step` ecosystem. When configured well, JWTs are a great way to sign and encode data. It's easy to use JWTs insecurely, though, so you must be deliberate about how you validate and verify them (see [RFC7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-7)).

`step-ca` produces JWTs that:
* are short-lived (5 minute lifespan)
* are one-time-use tokens (during the lifetime of the `step-ca`) 
* have a 1 minute clock drift leeway

If you're using `step-ca` JWTs in your code, be sure to [verify and validate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-7) every standard attribute of the JWT. [`step crypto jwt verify`](https://smallstep.com/docs/cli/crypto/jwt/verify/) can validate any JWT for you, and it follows the spec to the letter.

### Key Types and Ciphers

**Supported Key Types**: ECDSA, EdDSA, and RSA  
**Default Key Type**: ECDSA  
**Default Curve Bits**: P-256

We chose ECDSA keys because they offer better security and performance than RSA keys. At 256 bits, ECDSA keys provide 128 bits of security, and they are supported by most modern clients. 

More notes on the choice of key type:
* RSA keys are often chosen for compliance reasons.
* EdDSA keys are even smaller and faster than ECDSA keys. Were it supported by more clients, it would be the default.
* The NIST standard curves for ECDSA are hard to implement correctly, so there's concern that the implementations of them may have problems.
* If the NSA is in your threat model, you may not want to use ECDSA keys. The NSA has never published how they chose the magic numbers that drive ECDSA implementations.

**Default PEM Cipher**: AES128  
**Supported PEM Key Sizes**: 128, 192, and 256 bits

We've chosen the AES encryption algorithm for writing private keys to disk because it was the official choice of the Advanced Encryption Standard contest.

All supported key sizes are considered to be unbreakable for the foreseeable future. We chose 128 bits as our default because the performance is better as compared to the greater key sizes, and because 128 bits are sufficient for most security needs.

### X.509 Certificates

#### Root CA Certificate

The Root CA certificate is generated once, when you run [`step ca init`](/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/init).

**Validity (10 year window)**

- Not Before: Now
- Not After: Now + 10 years

A 10 year window is advisable until software and tools can be written for rotating the root certificate.

**Basic Constraints**

- CA: TRUE

  The root certificate is a certificate authority and will be used to sign other Certificates.

- Path Length: 1

  The Path Length constraint expresses the number of possible intermediate CA certificates in a path built from an end-entity certificate up to the CA certificate.

  The default `step` PKI has only one intermediate CA certificate between end-entity certificates and the root CA certificate.

**Key Usage**

Key Usage describes how the certificate can be used.

- Certificate Sign: indicates that our root public key will be used to verify a signature on certificates.
- CRL Sign: indicates that our root public key will be used to verify a signature on revocation information, such as CRL.

#### Intermediate CA Certificate

The Intermediate CA certificate is generated once, when you run [`step ca init`](/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/init). It is signed by the Root CA certificate.

The Path Length of the intermediate certificate is `0`. Otherwise it uses the same defaults as the root certificate.

A Path Length of zero indicates that there can be no additional intermediary certificates in the path between the intermediate CA certificate and end-entity certificates.

#### Leaf (End Entity) Certificate

These are the certificates issued by the `step-ca` server.

**Validity (24 hour window)**

- Not Before: Now
- Not After: Now + 24 hours

The default is a 24hr window. This value is somewhat arbitrary. However, our goal is to have seamless end-entity certificate rotation. Rotating certificates frequently is a good security measure because it gives attackers very little time to form an attack and limits the usefulness of any single private key in the system.

We will continue to work towards decreasing this window because we believe it significantly reduces the probability and effectiveness of any attack.

**Key Usage**

Key Usage describes how the certificate can be used.

- Key Encipherment: indicates that a certificate will be used with a protocol that encrypts keys.
- Digital Signature: indicates that this public key may be used as a digital signature to support security services that enable entity authentication and data origin authentication with integrity.

**Extended Key Usage**

- TLS Web Server Authentication: certificate can be used as the server side certificate in the TLS protocol.

- TLS Web Client Authentication: certificate can be used as the client side certificate in the TLS protocol.

### TLS Defaults

These are the defaults used for communication between `step` and `step-ca`.

**Min TLS Version**: TLS 1.2  
**Max TLS Version**: TLS 1.2

The PCI Security Standards Council required all payment processors and merchants to move to TLS 1.2 and above by June 30, 2018. By setting TLS 1.2 as the default for all TLS protocol negotiation, we encourage our users to adopt the same security conventions.

**Renegotiation**: Never

TLS renegotiation significantly complicates the state machine and has been the source of numerous, subtle security issues. Therefore, by default we disable it.

#### Default TLS Cipher Suites


```go nocopy
[
  "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305",
  "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",

The default 'ciphersuites' are a list of two cipher combinations. For communication between services running `step` there is no need for cipher suite negotiation. The server can specify a single cipher suite which the client is already known to support.

Reasons for selecting `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305`:

- ECDHE key exchange algorithm has perfect forward secrecy
- ECDSA has smaller keys and better performance than RSA
- CHACHA20 with POLY1305 is the cipher mode used by Google.
- CHACHA20's performance is better than GCM and CBC.

The http2 spec requires the `TLS_ECDHE_(RSA|ECDSA)_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` ciphersuite be accepted by the server, therefore it makes our list of default ciphersuites.

#### Approved TLS Cipher Suites

Above is a list of `step`-approved cipher suites. Not all communication can be
resolved with `step` TLS functionality. For those connections, the list of
server supported cipher suites must have more options in case older clients do
not support our favored cipher suite.

Reasons for selecting these cipher suites can be found in the following

Webhooks let you enrich X.509 or SSH certificates with data requested from an external endpoint. The CA fetches key/value pairs from a configured webhook when a CSR is being processed, and the webhook data is passed along to the provisioner's [certificate template](/docs/step-ca/templates).

Attach webhooks to [provisioners](/docs/step-ca/provisioners) using the `step ca provisioner webhook` command group.

## Quickstart

We've created an [example webhook server](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks). Use it to try out webhooks. Down the line, it could become the basis of your own custom webhook integration.

1. Initialize a new Certificate Authority with remote management enabled.

  ```bash
  step ca init --remote-management --context webhooks
  ```

  Then, in another window, start `step-ca`:

  ```bash
  step-ca --context webhooks
  ```

2. Clone the [example webhook repository](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks).

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks.git
  cd webhooks
  ```

3. Generate a server certificate for your webhook server.

  ```bash
  step ca certificate localhost webhook.crt webhook.key
  ```

4. Export the your root CA certificate for the webhook server.

  ```bash
  step ca root > root_ca.crt
  ```

5. Add a new provisioner to associate with your webhook.

  ```bash
  step ca provisioner add my_provisioner --create
  ```

6. Add a webhook to your provisioner for a webhook server that will be listening on `localhost:9443`.
  
  ☠️ Don't add your webhook to the default (administrative) CA provisioner!
  You may lock yourself out of your CA.

  ```bash
  step ca provisioner webhook add my_provisioner people --url 'https://localhost:9443/{{ .Token.sub }}'
  ```

  This command will print out the ID and secret for the `people` webhook.

7. Update the [`webhookIDsToSecrets` map](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks/blob/f6a74c2e30dcb19b15d9903fdb6271a8358d26cd/main.go#L31) in the webhook server's `main.go` file with the ID and secret printed above.

8. Update the [`db` map](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks/blob/f6a74c2e30dcb19b15d9903fdb6271a8358d26cd/main.go#L26) in the webhook server's `main.go` file with the Common Name (CN) you will be issuing test certificates for.

9. Start the webhook server:

  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```

10. Add a template to the provisioner to incorporate the data returned from the `people` webhook:

  ```bash
  cat <<EOF > external_ou.tmpl
  {
    "subject": {
      "organizationalUnit": {{ toJson .Webhooks.people.role }}
    }
  }
  EOF
  step ca provisioner update my_provisioner --x509-template external_ou.tmpl
  ```

11. Get a certificate with the provisioner you configured earlier:

  ```bash
  step ca certificate andrew@smallstep.com my.crt my.key --provisioner my_provisioner
  ```

12. Inspect the certificate. Notice that the user's role returned from the webhook server appears in the OU.

  ```bash
  step certificate inspect my.crt --format json | jq .subject
  ```

## Implementation Details

### Webhook Server Response

The webhook server must include `"allow": true` in the response body, or `step-ca` will refuse to sign the certificate request.

<Alert severity="warning">
  <AlertTitle>Webhooks Aren't For Authorization</AlertTitle>
  <div>
    Webhooks enrich certificates. They should not be used to delegate CSR authorization to an external server. Webhook are run early in the CA request processing cycle, and if policy decisions are made at this point it can create confusing interactions with other policy features of the CA.
  </div>
</Alert>

The `step-ca` template engine augments the template data with the `data` object in the response body.

For example, a webhook server could send the following JSON response:
```json
{
  "allow": true,
  "data": {
    "role": "eng"
  }
}
```

A template on the provisioner will then be able to reference the response under the path `.Webhooks.webhook_name`.
If the webhook was named `people`, the role in the webhook response could be accessed in a template under the field `.Webhooks.people.role`.

### Requests

All requests will use the `POST` method to send a JSON body to the webhook server containing a `timestamp` field.
Additional data will vary based on the type of the certificate being signed.
The [webhooks server example repository](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks) contains examples in Go of parsing webhook request bodies for both X.509 and SSH certificate requests.

#### X.509 Request Body

For X.509 certificates, `step-ca` will include an `x509CertificateRequest` field that will hold a [JSON representation of the request](https://pkg.go.dev/go.step.sm/crypto@v0.23.1/x509util#CertificateRequest) using the same schema as [x509 template functions](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/templates/#x509-templates) with a [few extra fields](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/c169defc73db6ba4b83e1acd5bd31feafb4df050/webhook/types.go#L19-L22).
When used with the [acme provisioner](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/provisioners#acme) and the `device-attest-01` challenge, the request body will also contain the verified device ID in the `attestationData.permanentIdentifier` field.

#### SSH Request Body

For SSH certificates `step-ca` will include an `sshCertificateRequest` field with [data from the request](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/c169defc73db6ba4b83e1acd5bd31feafb4df050/webhook/types.go#L37).


### Authentication

The webhook server must authenticate its connection with `step-ca` before responding.

#### Signature

Every webhook has a unique secret that will be displayed when the webhook is created with `step ca provisioner webhook add`.
`step-ca` will include a signature of the payload in the `X-Smallstep-Signature` header.
The webhook ID will also be included in the `X-Smallstep-Webhook-ID` header to help associate the correct signing secret with the webhook request.
Webhook servers must compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function, using the webhook signing secret as the key and the request body as the message.
See the [webhook server example repository](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks) for an example of verifying the signature.

#### Authorization Header (Optional)

For an additional layer of security, `step-ca` may be configured to send either a bearer token or a `username:password` in the `Authorization` header.

To use a bearer token, run:

```
step ca provisioner webhook update my_provisioner my_webhook --bearer-token abc123xyz
```

Or, to use basic authentication, run:

```
step ca provisioner webhook update my_provisioner my_webhook --basic-auth-username user --basic-auth-password pass
```

#### Mutual TLS Authentication

You can also use mutual TLS to authenticate `step-ca` from your webhook server.

By default, `step-ca` will send the CA's self-generated leaf certificate if the webhook server requests a client certificate. To enable mutual TLS, your webhook server should be configured to request and verify a client certificate that chains up to your root CA certificate.

This behavior can be disabled:

```
step ca provisioner webhook update my_provisioner my_webhook --disable-tls-client-auth
```

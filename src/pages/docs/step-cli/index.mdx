## Introduction to `step`

`step` is an easy-to-use CLI tool for building, operating, and automating Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems and workflows. `step` acts as front-end interface to [Certificate Manager](/certificate-manager) and [`step-ca`](/docs/step-ca), an online X.509 and SSH Certificate Authority (CA). `step` is also a standalone, general-purpose PKI toolkit: You can use it for many common crypto and X.509 operations.

## Using `step` with `step-ca`

If you'd like to use `step` with `step-ca`, head over to the [`step-ca` documentation](/docs/step-ca) for command usage information and examples.

## Examples that don't require `step-ca`

`step` has plenty of features that make crypto easier for the casual user.

Here's a few common uses of the `step` command that don't require `step-ca`:

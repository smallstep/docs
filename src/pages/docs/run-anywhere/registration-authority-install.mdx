# Registration Authority Install

### Dependencies

- Smallstep Platform
- VM(s) for registration authority instance(s) with externally-routable DNS
- ACME client with DNS routed for testing
- [step](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation) (on VM)
- [step-ca](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/installation) (on VM)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [KOTS](https://kots.io/kots-cli/getting-started/#how-to-install)

### Smallstep Platform Update

To complete the install, we'll need to be on the latest Beta channel release of the Smallstep Platform.

Your Smallstep representative will need to make sure that your license is set appropriately in our systems. If not, they will send you a new license file to add to your admin-console in KOTS.

In the *Version history* tab, check for the latest update and deploy it:

```bash
kubectl config use-context <your-context>
kubectl kots admin-console --namespace smallstep
```

### Certificate Manager CA Provisioner

When operating a registration authority, the RA must be able to request certificates from the managed CA. We'll configure the CA with a JWK provisioner for use by the RA. The RA itself will have its own provisioner(s) for clients it services.

Enter `admin-tools`:

```bash
kubectl config use-context <your-context>
kubectl exec -it -n smallstep deploy/admin-tools -- bash
```

Create a keypair that will be used in the JWK provisioner (escrowed by the CA). Save the provisioner password in a safe place for use by the RA(s).

```bash
step crypto jwk create jwk.pub jwk.priv
```

In `admin-tools`, create a new JWK provisioner (the values in the following code blocks are simply examples - please customize these to your needs as desired):

```bash
manage-provisioners --type JWK --name "ra@your-company.com" \
  --authority "certs.ca.smallstep.your-company.com" \
  --public-key "jwk.pub" --private-key "jwk.priv" \
  --duration "240h" --max-duration "720h" \
  add
```

Now you can safely delete the created keys:

```bash
rm jwk.pub jwk.priv
```

### RA Installation

Install the latest version of step-ca using the appropriate build from:

[https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/releases/tag/v0.18.0](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/releases/tag/v0.18.0)

On the VM that will host your registration authority, configure a `step-ca` instance in RA mode with an ACME provisioner.

Save the following as `/etc/step-ca/config/ca.json`:

```json
{
	"address": ":443",
	"dnsNames": ["smallstep-ra01.your-company.com"],
	"db": {
		"type": "badger",
		"dataSource": "/etc/step-ca/db"
	},
	"logger": {"format": "json"},
	"authority": {
		"type": "stepcas",
		"certificateAuthority": "https://certs.ca.smallstep.your-company.com",
		"certificateAuthorityFingerprint": "your-certificate-authority-fingerprint",
		"certificateIssuer": {
			"type": "jwk", 
			"provisioner": "ra@your-company.com"
		},
		"provisioners": [{
			"type": "ACME",
			"name": "acme",
		  "claims": {
				"defaultTLSCertDuration": "240h",
        "maxTLSCertDuration": "720h"
      }
		}]
	},
	"tls": {
		"cipherSuites": [
			"TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305",
 			"TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
		],
		"minVersion": 1.2,
		"maxVersion": 1.3,
		"renegotiation": false
	}
}
```

Use a secrets manager or whatever process best suits your organization to store the provisioner passsword in `/etc/step-ca/password.txt`.

Start `step-ca`:

```bash
step-ca --issuer-password-file /etc/step-ca/password.txt /etc/step-ca/config/ca.json
```

For a longer-term approach to running `step-ca` refer to [systemd daemon instructions](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/certificate-authority-server-production#running-step-ca-as-a-daemon).

### Test

Test certificate issuance with `step`:

```bash
step ca bootstrap --ca-url https://ra01.your-company.com --fingerprint your-certificate-authority-fingerprint
step ca certificate localhost local.crt local.key
```

Test certificate issuance from your ACME test client.

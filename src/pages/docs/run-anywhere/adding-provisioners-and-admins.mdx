description: Learn how to add provisioners and provisioner admins to a run anywhere deployment
---


Once you have a `run anywhere` deployment configured and all of your kubernetes pods are happy, now it is time to start adding provisioners and configuring your admin users. Provisioners authenticate certificate requests. Certificate lifetimes, access control policies, renewal, templates, and many other options are configurable per-provisioner. If you're unfamiliar with our provisioner types and capabilities, we have a [matrix](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/provisioners#authorization-scope-by-provisioner) available for reference.

### Dependencies

- An admin account on the Smallstep Platform
- The [step](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation) CLI tool

Before you begin, be sure you have [bootstrapped](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/bootstrap) your client device to your new certificate authority, and that you have been granted admin-level access rights.

### Managing Authority Admins

Authority admins have permission to add, update, and remove provisioners and authority admins.

To list all admins on your authority before adding new ones, use the `step` commands:

```bash
step ca admin list
```

See the [`step ca admin list` command reference](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/admin/list) for additional flags.

To add a new basic admin to a provisioner, run:

```bash
step ca admin add <email-address> <provisioner-name>
```

See the [`step ca admin add` command reference](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/admin/add) for additional flags.

You can also [update](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/admin/update) or [remove](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/admin/remove) admins with the `step ca admin` command group.

### Managing Provisioners

To review the configuration for all existing provisioners on your certificate authority, run:

```bash
step ca provisioner list
```

Check the existing configuration for a given provisioner by running [`step ca provisioner get`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/provisioner/get):

```bash
step ca provisioner get <provisioner-name>
```

To add a new provisioner, use [`step ca provisioner add`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/provisioner/add). There are several options for find-tuning a provisioner for your use case. On all provisioner types, you can constrain certificate lifetimes, configure templates to be used, and specify provisioner admins. Provisioner admins can issue certificates with arbitrary subjects. The [command reference](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/provisioner/add) describes other provisioner-specific configuration options that are available.

If you just want stand up a basic, password-based provisioner with default values to get moving, run:

```bash
step ca provisioner add <provisioner-name> --type JWK --create
```

You will be prompted to enter a password for the provisioner.

> For more information on each provisioner type and recommended configurations, please see our open source documentation on [How to Configure Provisioners](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/provisioners#authorization-scope-by-provisioner).

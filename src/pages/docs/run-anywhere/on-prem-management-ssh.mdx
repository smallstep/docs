description: Learn how to manage SSH Users and Hosts for an SSH run anywhere deployment
---


Once you have an SSH `run anywhere` deployment configured and all of your kubernetes pods are happy, now it is time to register your SSH Hosts and configure settings for your SSH Users. As follows are our instruction guides for each portion.

## Admin Console

The KOTS admin console is your primary interface to software updates from Smallstep. Port forward it to your local machine from your Kubernetes cluster using the [KOTS plugin](https://kots.io/kots-cli/getting-started/#how-to-install) for `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl kots admin-console --namespace smallstep
```

## Register SSH Hosts

Refer to the [manual step-by-step host instructions](https://smallstep.com/docs/ssh/hosts-step-by-step) from our documentation. However, you will need to provide one additional flag (`--team-url`) in Step 4 to bootstrap to your SSH authority from your on-premises platform installation:

```bash
step ca bootstrap --team="[team slug]" --team-url="https://api.[base domain]/v1/teams/<>/authorities/ssh"
```

## Configure SSH Clients (`step` CLI for Users)

Similarly to the host side, users can follow our [SSH Client Quickstart Guide](https://smallstep.com/app/teams/quickstart) but will need to provide the `--team-url` flag to reference your on-premises installation.

```bash
step ssh config --team [team-slug] --team-url="https://api.[base domain]/v1/teams/<>/authorities/ssh"
```

## Add Dashboard Admins

In an on-premises installation, admins are managed through the `admin-tools` pod in Kubernetes.

```bash
kubectl -n smallstep exec -it deploy/admin-tools -- bash

# inside the pod
ðŸ‘£ create-admin
```

Admins can reset their password by entering their email address on your dashboard login page, then selecting "I forgot my password."

### Prerequisites

You will need:

* An account on the smallstep platform  
  Need one? [Register here](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=ssh)
* Okta Super Administrator privileges
* Okta Lifecycle Management Subscription
* Two (or more) Okta groups:
  * A group whose members should be allowed to SSH (we'll refer to this as the `ssh` group, but you can call it whatever you want)
  * A group whose members should be allowed to `sudo` (we'll refer to this as the `sudo` group, but you can call it whatever you want)
  * You can use existing groups or create new ones (Directory → Groups → Add Group)
  * Make sure you add users that should be allowed to ssh/sudo to the respective groups (Directory → Groups → select group → Manage People)
  * For more granular access, you can create multiple groups and grant access to a subset of smallstep managed hosts.

### Features

The following provisioning features are supported:

* Push Groups and New Users
  * New users created through OKTA will also be created in the third party application.
* Push Profile or Group Updates
  * Updates made to the user's profile through OKTA will be pushed to the third party application.
* Push User Deactivation
  * Deactivating the user or disabling the user's access to the application through OKTA will deactivate the user in the third party application.
  * Note: For this application, deactivating a user means removing access to login, but maintaining the user's ssh access information as an inactive user.
* Reactivate Users
  * User accounts can be reactivated in the application.

## Overview

In this quickstart, we will:

1. Create a new OIDC application in Okta, for single sign-on
2. Enter OIDC details into the Smallstep SSH UI
3. Add and configure the Smallstep application from the Okta Application Directory, for user sync via SCIM
4. Check logs to confirm users and groups are syncing to Smallstep SSH

## Step By Step Instructions

### **Step 1. Create Okta OIDC Application**

1. Start at your Okta admin dashboard (access via "Admin" button next to "+ Add Apps" after successful log in)
2. Go to Applications → Create App Integration
3. In the pop up select "OIDC - OpenID Connect" as the sign-in method and specify "Native Application" for the Application type.

4. New Native App Integration Page
   * App integration name: `smallstep-oidc`
   * Sign-in redirect URIs: `http://127.0.0.1:10000`
   * Select "Skip group assignment for now"
   * All other value leave as default
   * click save

   ![](/graphics/quickstart/ssh-okta-uri-oidc-app.png "Create OpenID")

5. Go to the **General** tab → Scroll down to "Client Credentials" and choose "Edit"
   * Select "Use Client Authentication" radio button
   * Save

6. Go to the **Assignments** tab.
   * Assign any groups that will need either `sudo` and/or `ssh` access to hosts to the `smallstep-oidc` app:
     * Assignments → Assign → Assign to Group → Click "Assign" for `ssh`
     * Assignments → Assign → Assign to Group → Click "Assign" for `sudo`
     * Repeat this process for any other groups you created for controlling SSH/sudo access
7. Go back to **General** tab and scroll down to "Client Credentials." You'll refer to these values in the next step.

### Step 2. Enter your OIDC Details into the Smallstep dashboard

1. Open a new browser tab and log in to Smallstep: `https://smallstep.com/app/[TEAM-NAME]`
2. Navigate the Onboarding Dialog. If the dialog is not open, you can relaunch it by visiting the **Users** tab.

   ![](/graphics/quickstart/oidc-copy-2021.png "onboarding")

3. Copy and paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Okta.

   ![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-copy-oidcinfo.png "Client secret")

4. The **configuration endpoint** is derived from your Okta domain. Fill your Okta domain into the following URL:

       https://{your Okta domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration

   This is your **Configuration Endpoint**. For example, if you normally sign into Okta at `https://example.okta.com/`, then your configuration endpoint is `https://example.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

   You can copy your Okta domain from the OIDC application General tab under General Settings

5. Click **"SAVE"**
6. You've completed this portion of the setup.

### Step 3. Add the Smallstep App Integration and Configure User Sync in Okta

* In the OKTA admin console, add the Smallstep application
  * Applications → Browse App Catalog
    * Search for `Smallstep`
    * Select the Smallstep app:

      ![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-app-tile.png "Smallstep Tile")
* Click "Add"

  ![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-app-add.png)

* Select "Do not display application icon to users"
* Select "Do not display application icon in the Okta Mobile App"
* De-select "Automatically log in when user lands on login page"
* Click Next

  ![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-app-signon.png)

* Select "Administrator sets username, user sets password"
* Application username format: "Okta username prefix"
* Update application username on "Create and update"
* Done
* **Provisioning**
  * Select the "Provisioning" tab
  * Click "Configure API Integration" and select the checkbox next to "**Enable API integration**"

  ![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-enable-api.png "Enable API")

* Return to the Smallstep dashboard, or open a new browser tab and sign into the Smallstep dashboard: `https://smallstep.com/app/[TEAM-NAME]`
* Navigate to the Onboarding UI → Add Your Team → SCIM Details
* Copy **Base URL,** and **API Token** from Smallstep dashboard, and paste into Okta Provisioning form.
* In Okta, choose **Test API Credentials**. After successful verification, choose **Save**.

* Reload the provision tab
* Under Provisioning → Settings → To App, choose **Edit** and enable
  * Create Users
  * Update User Attributes
  * Deactivate Users

  ![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-enable-sync.png "enable and save")

* Assignments
  * Select the **Assignments** tab → Click **Assign**  → **Assign to Groups**
  * Search by group → Assign any groups that will need either `sudo` and/or `ssh` access to hosts
  * Group names that contain a `/` are not supported in this release.
* Push Groups
  * Select the **Push Groups** tab → **Push Groups** → **Find Groups By Name**
  * Search for the same groups that will need either `sudo` and/or `ssh` access to hosts.
  * Save.
  * Repeat for each desired group.

### Step 4. Sign in to the smallstep UI

Sign in at `https://smallstep.com/app/[Team ID]`

* Select the **Logs** tab. You should see a list of success messages assocated with `SCIM-SYNC` catagory items.

   ![](/graphics/quickstart/scim-logs.png "SCIM Logs")

* Select the **Users** tab. If the onboarding dialog is open, press `Esc` to close.
* You should see your Users and Groups synced over from Okta.

### OKTA Configuration Complete

## Troubleshooting Tips

* Initial activation of Okta OIDC provisioning in Smallstep SSH requires entering your **Client ID, Client Secret**, and **base domain of your Okta instance.** Contact smallstep support with any questions | [support@smallstep.com](mailto:support@smallstep.com)
* UIDs and GIDs. By default, Smallstep will auto-assign POSIX UIDs and GIDs for your users. Alternatively, you can sync POSIX UIDs and GIDs values from your Okta directory to Smallstep.
  * See our guide [How to sync UIDs and GIDs from Okta](/docs/ssh/okta-gid-uid).
* If you are having trouble synchronizing users or groups, it's always recommended to resynchronize the information manually:
  * Applications  → Smallstep → Push Groups → Find Group → "Push Now'

![](/graphics/quickstart/okta-push-groups.png)

* When users are deactivated in Okta, they will be deactivated in Smallstep. Users will not be able to SSH to servers, but their user accounts will remain on smallstep managed hosts. To permanently delete user data on smallstep managed hosts, contact Smallstep Support | [support@smallstep.com](mailto:support@smallstep.com)

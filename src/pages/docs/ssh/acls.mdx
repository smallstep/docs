### Prerequisites

You will need:

* A Smallstep [SSH Professional account](https://smallstep.com/sso-ssh/#overview). Need one â†’ [Register here](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=ssh)
* SSO and User Sync configured and functioning
* Hosts Registered with Tags

### Features

The following features are supported:

* Access control by Host Tags configuration using Groups synchronized from your IDP

## Step By Step Instructions

### Step 0: Understanding Host Tags

**Host Tags** (key-value pairs) are the pillar our access control model. Rather than mapping people or groups directly to hosts, you'll map _tag combinations_ to your hosts and to your user groups. First you'll put your hosts into logical groups using tags, eg. `role`:`web` or `env`:`staging`. Then, you'll grant user groups access to all hosts with a specific tag combination. Finally, you'll choose which user group tag combinations will allow `sudo` privileges on any matching hosts.

Let's look at an example:

* The `developers` group will have access to  `myserver #1` only.
* The `data` group will have access to  `myserver #2` and  `myserver #3`.
* The `ops` group will have `sudo` access to `myserver #2` and `myserver #3`.

Of course, hosts and groups can have as many tag combinations as you like.  Take a minute to think about how you'd like to use Host Tags in your environment.

### Step 1: Determine Host Tag Combination

Sign in at `https://smallstep.com/app/[Team ID]`
* Choose "SSH Professional" from the top navigation bar
* Choose "Hosts" on the right hand navigation bar
* Find and select a Host that includes the Host Tags you wish to use for access grants.
  * In the example below that combination is `database` : `production`.
* Make a note of the tag combination, you will need this in Step 2

### Step 2: Grant User Group Access to Host(s)

On your Smallstep Dasbhoard.
* Select the "Users" tab on the right hand navigation bar.
* Choose the "GROUPS" tab

* Select the User Group that you want to configure for access control. You will see the user group detail page with a list of existing Host Grants and a form to add additional grants.
* Select "Edit" from the kebab menu to the right of the Group's name.
  * Enter the tag values from Step 1
  * If Sudo access is permitted for this user group, select the "Allow Sudo" checkbox
  * Click the checkbox to enable access control
* **Optional**. Assign Posix Groups. Smallstep now supports posix group support on hosts running step-ssh version 0.22.0 and greater so SSH Pro users can have more granular access to Hosts. 
**Managed Groups** are posix groups that you want smallstep to create or delete on your Hosts.
**Unmanaged Groups** are posix groups such as  ***fax*** or  ***floppy*** that are default or already exist on the Host. Groups members will have permissions assigned to these groups.
  * In the example below we are adding the group to one unmanaged group ***floppy*** and and managed group ***sre-team***
* **Optional**. Assign Certificate Principals. Smallstep now supports adding additional prinicals to user certificates. A **Principal** is a string that allows access to a host, or even a specific user on a host.
Users in the assigned group will be able to access smallstep managed hosts as that user.
  * In the example below we are adding the principal ***craig*** to the Group.

* All users in the group now have access to all hosts with the specified tag combination.


**Posix Groups** Smallstep now gives SSH professional accounts the ability to map  Groups to Posix Groups on Hosts.

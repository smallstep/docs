title: Enroll a Smallstep SSH Host Manually
description: Smallstep SSH Manual Host Installation Instructions | Smallstep Documentation
---


These are the instructions for setting up a host by hand.
We also have [an installation script](/docs/ssh/hosts),
which is the preferred setup method.

### Step 1. Run all steps as root

Now let's set up your host. You'll run the entire Host Configuration setup as the `root` user:

```shell
sudo su
```

### Step 2. Install `step` CLI tool

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="curl -L -o step https://dl.step.sm/s3/cli/docs-ssh-host-step-by-step/step-linux-0.18.0 && install -m 0755 -t /usr/bin step">
{`$ curl -L -o step https://dl.step.sm/s3/cli/docs-ssh-host-step-by-step/step-linux-0.18.0
$ install -m 0755 -t /usr/bin step`}
</CodeBlock>

### Step 3. Install the `step-ssh` utilities

This step will install modules and services.

* **Install on Ubuntu & Debian (DEB package)**

  <CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="curl -LO https://dl.step.sm/s3/ssh/docs-ssh-host-step-by-step/step-ssh_0.19.9_amd64.deb && dpkg -i step-ssh_0.19.9_amd64.deb">
  {`$ curl -LO https://dl.step.sm/s3/ssh/docs-ssh-host-step-by-step/step-ssh_0.19.9_amd64.deb\n$ dpkg -i step-ssh_0.19.9_amd64.deb`}
  </CodeBlock>

* **Install on CentOS or Amazon Linux 2 (RPM package)**

  <CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText={`curl -LO "https://dl.step.sm/s3/ssh/docs-ssh-host-step-by-step/step-ssh_0.19.9_x86_64.rpm" && yum -y install step-ssh_0.19.9_x86_64.rpm`}>
  {`$ curl -LO "https://dl.step.sm/s3/ssh/docs-ssh-host-step-by-step/step-ssh_0.19.9_x86_64.rpm"\n$ yum -y install step-ssh_0.19.9_x86_64.rpm`}
  </CodeBlock>

### Step 4. Configure `step` to connect to your CA

```shell
step ca bootstrap --team="[your smallstep team ID]"
```

### Step 5. Get an SSH host certificate

Remember the enrollment token you got when you signed up? You'll need it now. If you downloaded it, the file is called `enrollment_token`.

`_`👇 This leading space will (usually) keep the token out of your shell's history.

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText={` export enrollment_token="[your enrollment token]" && export hostname="[your hostname]"`}>
{`$  export enrollment_token="[your enrollment token]"
$ export hostname="[your hostname]"`}
</CodeBlock>

The `hostname` is your host's canonical hostname or IP. This will be the name clients use to SSH to this host.

#### For hosts with a single hostname

Run the following to issue a certificate for your host:

```shell
step ssh certificate $hostname /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub \
    --host --sign --provisioner "Service Account" --token $enrollment_token
```

#### If a host has multiple hostnames...

> **Note:** When a host has multiple hostnames, your users will only be able to `ssh` to the canonical `$hostname`, as shown by the `step ssh hosts` command.

If you need multiple hostnames in your host certificate (e.g., public and private hostnames, or a hostname and an IP address), you can pass each of them to `step ssh certificate` via the `--principal` flag:

```shell
step ssh certificate $hostname /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub \
    --host --sign --provisioner "Service Account" --token $enrollment_token \
    --principal $hostname --principal 10.0.0.42
```

When multiple hostnames are needed, the canonical `$hostname` must be passed twice: Once to establish the certificate's Key ID, and again explicitly as its first Principal.

### Step 6. Configure SSHD to use certificate authentication

```shell
step ssh config --host --set Certificate=ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub \
                         --set Key=ssh_host_ecdsa_key
```

This command will add a few lines of configuration to the end of your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to enable certificate authentication. These lines are annotated with a comment that says `# autogenerated by step @ <timestamp>` so you can identify them later if you need to modify or revert these changes.

### Step 7. Activate PAM/NSS Modules & HUP SSHD

```shell
step-ssh activate "$hostname"
```

The `step-ssh activate` command will leverage a short-lived identity certificate to authenticate itself to the host inventory.

### Step 8. Register the host and add tags(s)

This command will leverage the host identity certificate to authenticate itself to the host inventory.

```shell
step-ssh-ctl register --hostname "$hostname"
```

#### Registering a host with host tags

For access control in multi-user environments, [host tags](#step-0-understanding-host-tags) can be assigned via the `--tag` flag.

```shell
step-ssh-ctl register --tag <key=value> --tag <role=web> --hostname "$hostname"
```

It is possible to rerun `step-ssh-ctl register` multiple times, to rename the host, replace its tags, or change the bastion settings. **Note: This command replaces all existing tags and bastion settings for a host.**

#### Registering a bastion host (jump boxes)

If the host you're registering is a bastion, add the `--is-bastion` flag:

```shell
step-ssh-ctl register --hostname "$hostname" --is-bastion
```

**Note:** Your bastion host will need the `nc` command installed. Our bastion host support uses `nc` (along with the `ProxyCommand` directive) because it's widely compatible with older SSHD servers.

#### Registering a host behind a bastion

If the host you're registering is _behind_ a bastion, add the `--bastion` flag:

```shell
step-ssh-ctl register --hostname "$hostname" --bastion "[bastion hostname]"
```

### Step 9. Test your installation

Before you sign out of your `sudo` session, test your installation by logging in and running `sudo` in a separate session.

**This step is especially important if you have made any non-standard changes to your PAM or NSS stacks.**

Now sign in at `https://smallstep.com/app/[Team ID]`

You should see your host listed under the "**Hosts**" tab.

## Description

**step ssh certificate** command generates an SSH key pair and creates a
certificate using [step certificates](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates).

With a certificate clients or servers may trust only the CA key and verify its
signature on a certificate rather than trusting many user/host keys.

Note that not all the provisioner types will be able to generate user and host
certificates. Currently JWK provisioners can generate both, but with an OIDC
provisioner you will only be able to generate user certificates unless you are
and admin that can generate both. With a cloud identity provisioner you will
only be able to generate host certificates.

To configure a server to accept user certificates and provide a user certificate
you need to add the following lines in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```shell
# The path to the CA public key, it accepts multiple user CAs, one per line
TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ssh_user_key.pub

# Path to the private key and certificate
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub
```

Make sure to restart the sshd daemon to refresh its configuration.

To configure clients to accept host certificates you need to add the host CA public
key in `~/.ssh/known_hosts` with the following format:
```shell
@cert-authority *example.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE...=
```

Where `*.example.com` is a pattern that matches the hosts and
`ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE...=` should be the contents of the host CA public key.

## Positional arguments

`key-id`
The certificate identity. If no principals are passed we will use
the key-id as a principal, if it has the format abc@def then the principal will
be abc.

`key-file`
The private key name when generating a new key pair, or the public
key path when we are just signing it.

## Options


**-f**, **--force**
Force the overwrite of files without asking.

**--insecure**


**--no-password**
Do not ask for a password to encrypt a private key. Sensitive key material will
be written to disk unencrypted. This is not recommended. Requires **--insecure** flag.

**--not-before**=`time|duration`
The `time|duration` when the certificate validity period starts. If a `time` is
used it is expected to be in RFC 3339 format. If a `duration` is used, it is a
sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such
as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms",
"s", "m", "h".

**--not-after**=`time|duration`
The `time|duration` when the certificate validity period ends. If a `time` is
used it is expected to be in RFC 3339 format. If a `duration` is used, it is a
sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such
as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms",
"s", "m", "h".

**--offline**
Creates a certificate without contacting the certificate authority. Offline mode
uses the configuration, certificates, and keys created with **step ca init**,
but can accept a different configuration file using **--ca-config** flag.

**--provisioner**=`name`, **--issuer**=`name`
The provisioner `name` to use.

**--token**=`token`
The one-time `token` used to authenticate with the CA in order to create the
certificate.

**--set**=`key=value`
The `key=value` pair with template data variables. Use the **--set** flag multiple times to add multiple variables.

**--set-file**=`file`
The JSON `file` with the template data variables.

**--add-user**
Create a user provisioner certificate used to create a new user.

**--host**
Create a host certificate instead of a user certificate.

**--host-id**=`UUID`
Specify a `UUID` to identify the host rather than using an auto-generated UUID.
      If "machine" is passed, derive a UUID from "/etc/machine-id."

**--password-file**=`file`
The path to the `file` containing the password to encrypt the private key.

**--principal**=`name`, **-n**=`name`
Add the specified principal (user or host `name`s) to the certificate request.
      This flag can be used multiple times. However, it cannot be used in conjunction
      with '--token' when requesting certificates from OIDC, JWK, and X5C provisioners, or
      from any provisioner with 'disableCustomSANs' set to 'true'. These provisioners will
      use the contents of the token to determine the principals.

**--private-key**=`value`
When signing an existing public key, use this flag to specify the corresponding
private key so that the pair can be added to an SSH Agent.

**--provisioner-password-file**=`file`
The path to the `file` containing the password to decrypt the one-time token
      generating key.

**--sign**
Sign the public key passed as an argument instead of creating one.

**--kty**=`kty`
The `kty` to build the certificate upon.
If unset, default is EC.

`kty` is a case-sensitive string and must be one of:

- **EC**: Create an **elliptic curve** keypair

- **OKP**: Create an octet key pair (for **"Ed25519"** curve)

- **RSA**: Create an **RSA** keypair

**--crv**=`curve`, **--curve**=`curve`
The elliptic `curve` to use for EC and OKP key types. Corresponds
to the **"crv"** JWK parameter. Valid curves are defined in JWA [RFC7518]. If
unset, default is P-256 for EC keys and Ed25519 for OKP keys.

`curve` is a case-sensitive string and must be one of:

- **P-256**: NIST P-256 Curve

- **P-384**: NIST P-384 Curve

- **P-521**: NIST P-521 Curve

- **Ed25519**: Ed25519 Curve

**--size**=`size`
The `size` (in bits) of the key for RSA and oct key types. RSA keys require a
minimum key size of 2048 bits. If unset, default is 2048 bits for RSA keys and 128 bits for oct keys.

**--comment**=`value`
The comment used when adding the certificate to an agent. Defaults to the subject if not provided.

**--kms**=`uri`
The `uri` to configure a Cloud KMS or an HSM.

**--x5c-cert**=`chain`
Certificate (`chain`) in PEM format to store in the 'x5c' header of a JWT.

**--x5c-key**=`file`
Private key `file`, used to sign a JWT, corresponding to the certificate that will
be stored in the 'x5c' header.

**--x5c-chain**=`file`
Certificate `file`, in PEM format

**--nebula-cert**=`file`
Certificate `file` in PEM format to store in the 'nebula' header of a JWT.

**--nebula-key**=`file`
Private key `file`, used to sign a JWT, corresponding to the certificate that will
be stored in the 'nebula' header.

**--k8ssa-token-path**=`file`
Configure the `file` from which to read the kubernetes service account token.

**--no-agent**
Do not add the generated certificate and associated private key to the SSH agent.

**--ca-config**=`file`
The certificate authority configuration `file`. Defaults to
$(step path)/config/ca.json

**--ca-url**=`URI`
`URI` of the targeted Step Certificate Authority.

**--root**=`file`
The path to the PEM `file` used as the root certificate authority.

**--context**=`name`
The context `name` to apply for the given command.

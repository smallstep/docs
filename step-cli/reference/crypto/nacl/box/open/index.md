## Usage

```raw
step crypto nacl box open <nonce> <sender-pub-key> <priv-key>
[--raw]
```

## Description

Authenticate and decrypt a box produced by seal using the specified KEY. If
PRIV_KEY is encrypted you will be prompted for the password. The sealed box is
read from STDIN and the decrypted plaintext is written to STDOUT.

The nonce provided when the box was sealed.

To use a binary nonce use the prefix 'base64:' and the standard base64
encoding. e.g. base64:081D3pFPBkwx1bURR9HQjiYbAUxigo0Z

`sender-pub-key`
The path to the public key of the peer that produced the sealed box.

`priv-key`
The path to the private key used to open the box.

## Options

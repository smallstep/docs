</Alert>

Webhooks let you enrich X.509 or SSH certificates with data requested from an external endpoint.
The CA fetches key/value pairs from a configured webhook when a CSR is being processed,
and the webhook data is passed along to the provisioner's [certificate template](./templates.mdx).

Attach webhooks to [provisioners](./provisioners.mdx) via the `step ca provisioner webhook` command group.

# Quickstart

We've created an [example webhook server](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks).
You can use it to try out webhooks locally,
or as the basis of your own custom webhook integration.

1. Initialize a new Certificate Authority with remote management enabled.

   ```bash
   step ca init --remote-management --context webhooks
   ```

   Then, in another window, start `step-ca`:

   ```bash
   step-ca --context webhooks
   ```

2. Clone the [example webhook repository](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks.git
   cd webhooks
   ```

3. Generate a server certificate for your webhook server.

   ```bash
   step ca certificate localhost webhook.crt webhook.key
   ```

4. Export your root CA certificate for the webhook server.

   ```bash
   step ca root > root_ca.crt
   ```

5. Add a new provisioner to associate with your webhook.
   When asked, the default admin username is `step`.
 
   ```bash
   step ca provisioner add my_provisioner --create
   ```

6. Add a webhook to your provisioner for a webhook server that will be listening on `localhost:9443`.

   ☠️ Don't add your webhook to the default (administrative) CA provisioner!
   You may lock yourself out of your CA.
 
   ```bash
   step ca provisioner webhook add my_provisioner people --url 'https://localhost:9443/{{ .Token.sub }}'
   ```
 
   This command will print out the ID and secret for the `people` webhook.

7. Update the [`webhookIDsToSecrets` map](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks/blob/f6a74c2e30dcb19b15d9903fdb6271a8358d26cd/main.go#L31) in the webhook server's `main.go` file with the ID and secret printed above.

8. Update the [`db` map](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks/blob/f6a74c2e30dcb19b15d9903fdb6271a8358d26cd/main.go#L26) in the webhook server's `main.go` file with the Common Name (CN) you will be issuing test certificates for.

9. Start the webhook server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

10. Add a template to the provisioner to incorporate the data returned from the `people` webhook:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF > external_ou.tpl
    {
      "subject": {
        "organizationalUnit": {{ toJson .Webhooks.people.role }}
      }
    }
    EOF
    step ca provisioner update my_provisioner --x509-template external_ou.tpl
    ```

11. Get a certificate with the provisioner you configured earlier:

    ```bash
    step ca certificate andrew@smallstep.com my.crt my.key --provisioner my_provisioner
    ```

12. Inspect the certificate. Notice that the user's role returned from the webhook server appears in the OU.

    ```bash
    step certificate inspect my.crt --format json | jq .subject
    ```

# Implementation Details

## Authentication

Your webhook server must authenticate each request from the CA.

When you create a webhook, `step-ca` generates a signing secret
and uses that secret to sign webhook requests.
The webhook server must confirm this signature
by verifying the `X-Smallstep-Signature` request header.

In addition to the signature header, you can optionally enable two other request authentication methods:
- **Authorization Header**  
  The CA can send a bearer token or username and password in an `Authentication` header.
- **Mutual TLS**  
  The webhook server can require and verify the connection using mutual TLS. The CA will provide a client certificate when requested.

### Verifying Signature and ID Headers (required)

Every webhook has a signing secret that will be displayed when the webhook is created
via `step ca provisioner webhook add`.

Using the signing secret, `step-ca` will include a signature of the request body in the `X-Smallstep-Signature` header.

To verify the `X-Smallstep-Signature` request header,
webhook servers must compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function
over the request body,
using the webhook signing secret as the key.

To differentiate between several webhooks mapped to a single server,
the webhook ID is included in the `X-Smallstep-Webhook-ID` header.

See the [webhook server example repository](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks) for a Go example of signature verification.

### Authorization Header (optional)

For an additional layer of security, `step-ca` may be configured to send
either a bearer token
or a `username:password` value in the `Authorization` header.

To use a bearer token, run:

```
step ca provisioner webhook update my_provisioner my_webhook --bearer-token abc123xyz
```

Or, to use basic authentication, run:

```
step ca provisioner webhook update my_provisioner my_webhook --basic-auth-username user --basic-auth-password-file pass.txt
```

### Mutual TLS Authentication (optional)

You can also use mutual TLS to authenticate `step-ca` as a client of your webhook server.

By default, `step-ca` will send the CA's self-generated leaf certificate
when asked for a client certificate as part of the TLS handshake.
To enable mutual TLS,
configure your webhook server to request and verify a client certificate
that chains up to your root CA certificate.

## Webhook Requests

All requests from `step-ca` to the webhook server
will use the `POST` method to send a JSON body
to the webhook server containing a `timestamp` field.
Additional data will vary
based on the type of the certificate being signed.

See the [webhooks server example repository](https://github.com/smallstep/webhooks)
for a Go example of parsing webhook request bodies for both X.509 and SSH certificate requests.

### X.509 Request Body

For X.509 certificates, `step-ca` will include an `x509CertificateRequest` field
that will hold a [JSON representation of the request](https://pkg.go.dev/go.step.sm/crypto@v0.23.1/x509util#CertificateRequest)
using the same schema as [x509 template functions](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/templates/#x509-templates)
with a [few extra fields](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/c169defc73db6ba4b83e1acd5bd31feafb4df050/webhook/types.go#L19-L22).

#### Webhooks for ACME `device-attest-01`

You can use webhooks to enrich device certificates issued via an ACME `device-attest-01` challenge.
When used with the [ACME provisioner](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/provisioners#acme)
and the ACME `device-attest-01` challenge,
the request body will also contain the verified device ID in the `attestationData.permanentIdentifier` field.

#### Webhooks for SCEP challenges

Webhooks can also be used to validate SCEP challenges when a SCEP provisioner is in use.
Add a webhook to your SCEP provisioner using the CLI: 

  ```bash
  step ca provisioner webhook add my_scep_provisioner scepchallenge --url 'https://localhost:9443/scepvalidation' --kind SCEPCHALLENGE
  ```

When a SCEP client requests a certificate with a challenge password embedded, the webhook server will receive a request.
The request will contain the `scepChallenge` provided by the client and the `scepTransactionID` from the SCEP request.
Unlike webhooks configured on other provisioners, when a single SCEP provisioner is configured with multiple `SCEPCHALLENGE` webhooks, 
only a single one of the `SCEPCHALLENGE` webhooks needs to indicate the request is allowed for the certificate to be issued.

### Webhooks for Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) and X5C Provisioners

When signing requests are authorized by one of these provisioners, the request body will also contain the authorizing principal(s)
from the request. For cloud provisioners, this will be the instance identifier from the [Instance Identity Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html),
and for X5C provisioners, this will be the certificate subject of the presented leaf certificate.

### SSH Request Body

For SSH certificates `step-ca` will include an `sshCertificateRequest` field with [data from the request](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/c169defc73db6ba4b83e1acd5bd31feafb4df050/webhook/types.go#L37).


## Webhook Server Response

The webhook server must include `"allow": true` in the response body,
or `step-ca` will refuse to sign the certificate request.

The `step-ca` template engine augments the template data with the `data` object in the response body.

For example, a webhook server could send the following JSON response:
```json
{
  "allow": true,
  "data": {
    "role": "eng"
  }
}
```

A template on the provisioner will then be able to reference the response under the path `.Webhooks.webhook_name`.
If the webhook was named `people`, the role in the webhook response could be accessed in a template under the field `.Webhooks.people.role`.

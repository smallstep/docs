title: Certificate Revocation
---

The hardware, software and policies for managing and distributing public keys and certificates is called Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). 

The beauty of certificate-based PKI is that once certificates are issued, the infrastructure itself can be completely decentralized.
You can independently validate any certificate you receive without communicating with any central authority.

Certificate-based is PKI inherently fault-tolerant, and trivial to scale.

With simplicity comes an inherent trade-off:
Once a certificate is issued, the certificate authority (CA) can't un-issue it.
It's valid until it expires.
Certificates do eventually expire,
but until they do, a bad actor can use a compromised private key to impersonate the certificate owner.

This is one reason `step-ca` is designed to issue short-lived certificates.
When you revoke a certificate in `step-ca`, the CA will block the certificate's future renewal.
This is called _passive revocation_.
Passive revocation is a good option for internal PKI,
because it avoids the complexity of relying on centralized third parties to check the real-time revocation status of a certificate.

A certificate that has been passively revoked will still be valid for the remainder of it's validity period.

Contrast this with _active revocation_ techniques used on the public internet.
Web TLS certificates are valid for up to a year.
Web browsers have to check CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) or use OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) to verify that every certificate they receive has not been revoked.
Active revocation requires clients to take an active role in certificate validation for the benefit of real-time certificate status.

### 1. Create a certificate for localhost

Let's create a certificate that we'll revoke in a minute.

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca certificate localhost localhost.crt localhost.key
✔ Key ID: n2kqNhicCCqVxJidspCQrjXWBtGwsa9zk3eBObrViy8 (sebastian@smallstep.com)
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
✔ CA: https://ca.smallstep.com
✔ Certificate: localhost.crt
✔ Private Key: localhost.key

$ step certificate inspect --short localhost.crt
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2400...2409]
Subject:     localhost
Issuer:      Smallstep Intermediate CA
Provisioner: sebastian@smallstep.com [ID: n2kq...Viy8]
Valid from:  2019-04-23T22:55:54Z
        to:  2019-04-24T22:55:54Z
```

### 2. Renew the certificate

Before revoking the certificate, note that it can be renewed with [`step ca renew`](../step-cli/reference/ca/renew).

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca renew localhost.crt localhost.key
✔ Would you like to overwrite localhost.crt [y/n]: y
Your certificate has been saved in localhost.crt.
# Make sure the from timestamp is "newer"

$ step certificate inspect --short localhost.crt
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 5963...8406]
Subject:     localhost
Issuer:      Smallstep Intermediate CA
Provisioner: sebastian@smallstep.com [ID: n2kq...Viy8]
Valid from:  2019-04-23T22:57:50Z
        to:  2019-04-24T22:57:50Z
```

### 3. Revoke the certificate

There's two methods for revoking a certificate:
- Pass the certificate's unique serial number to the CA
- Pass the certificate and private key to the CA

<Alert severity="info">
  You can only revoke a certificate once. Any repeated attempts to revoke the same serial number will fail.
</Alert>

#### Revoke the certificate using its serial number

Using the serial number method, you have to authenticate your request (in this case, with the CA's provisioner password):

```shell-session nocopy
$ step certificate inspect --format=json localhost.crt | jq .serial_number
"59636004850364466675608080466579278406"

$ step ca revoke 59636004850364466675608080466579278406
✔ Key ID: n2kqNhicCCqVxJidspCQrjXWBtGwsa9zk3eBObrViy8 (sebastian@smallstep.com)
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
✔ CA: https://ca.smallstep.com
Certificate with Serial Number 59636004850364466675608080466579278406 has been revoked.
```

#### Revoke the certificate using the certificate and private key

In this case, the certificate and key authenticate the request, so you don't need a password:

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="step ca revoke --cert localhost.crt --key localhost.key"
  >{`$ step ca revoke --cert localhost.crt --key localhost.key
Certificate with Serial Number 59636004850364466675608080466579278406 has been revoked.`}</CodeBlock>

### 4. Check that the certificate has been revoked

You'll get an HTTP 401 error when you try to renew it.

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="step ca renew localhost.crt localhost.key"
  >{`$ step ca renew localhost.crt localhost.key
error renewing certificate: The request lacked necessary authorization to be completed. Please
see the certificate authority logs for more info. 
log trace from CA:

### Using a revocation token

You can also revoke a certificate in two steps by first creating a revocation token and then exchanging that token in a revocation request.

```shell-session nocopy
$ TOKEN=$(step ca token --revoke 59636004850364466675608080466579278406)
✔ Key ID: n2kqNhicCCqVxJidspCQrjXWBtGwsa9zk3eBObrViy8 (sebastian@smallstep.com)
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:

$ echo $TOKEN | step crypto jwt inspect --insecure
{
"header": {
    "alg": "ES256",
    "kid": "uxEunU9UhUo96lRvKgpEtRevkzbN5Yq88AFFtb1nSGg",
    "typ": "JWT"
},
"payload": {
    "aud": "https://localhost:443/1.0/revoke",
    "exp": 1556395590,
    "iat": 1556395290,
    "iss": "sebastian@smallstep.com",
    "jti": "1f222fc1a22530b7bcd2a40d7308c566c8e49f90413bc350e07bfabc8002b79b",
    "nbf": 1556395290,
    "sha": "fef4c75a050e1f3a31175ca4f4fdb711cbef1efcd374fcae4700596604eb8e5a",
    "sub": "59636004850364466675608080466579278406"
},
"signature": "M1wX0ea3VXwS5rIim0TgtcCXHDtvP1GWD15cJSvVkrHNO6XMYl6m3ZmnWdwMi976msv-n2GTG3h6dJ3j2ImdfQ"
}

$ step ca revoke --token $TOKEN 59636004850364466675608080466579278406
Certificate with Serial Number 59636004850364466675608080466579278406 has been revoked.
```

You can also revoke certificates in _offline_ mode:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca revoke --offline 59636004850364466675608080466579278406
Certificate with Serial Number 59636004850364466675608080466579278406 has been revoked.

$ step ca revoke --offline --cert localhost.crt --key localhost.key
Certificate with Serial Number 59636004850364466675608080466579278406 has been revoked.
```

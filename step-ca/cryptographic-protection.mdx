By default, `step-ca` stores its signing keys encrypted on disk.

For security hardening,
you may desire more advanced cryptographic protection (or hardware protection)
of your CA's signing keys.

For these scenarios, `step-ca` integrates with the following key management systems:

- [Google Cloud KMS](#google-cloud-kms)
- [AWS KMS](#aws-kms)
- [Azure Key Vault](#azure-key-vault)
- [PKCS #11 hardware security modules (HSMs)](#pkcs-11)
- [TPM 2.0](#tpm-20)
- [YubiKey PIV](#yubikey-piv)
- ssh-agent
- Microsoft CryptoAPI

For a complete, end-to-end example using a YubiKey,
see our blog post [Build a Tiny Certificate Authority For Your Homelab](https://smallstep.com/blog/build-a-tiny-ca-with-raspberry-pi-yubikey/).

## Before You Begin

The `step ca init` command has very limited support for keys not stored on disk. We've created the [`step kms` plugin](https://github.com/smallstep/step-kms-plugin) for managing the keys and certificates on cloud KMSs and on hardware devices. Please install this plugin before continuing with any of the examples below.

## Google Cloud KMS

[Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs) is Google's cloud-hosted KMS that allows you to store the cryptographic keys and sign certificates using their infrastructure. Cloud KMS supports two key protection levels: `SOFTWARE` and `HSM`.

### Creating your PKI in Google Cloud KMS

Please install the [`step kms` plugin](https://github.com/smallstep/step-kms-plugin) before you begin. You'll need it to create your PKI.

Also, make sure you have installed [the `gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and have [configured Google Cloud application default credentials](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials) in your local environment, eg. by running `gcloud auth application-default login`.

Next, let's generate a private key for your Root CA. The `step kms create` command will also [create a Cloud KMS key ring](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-key-ring) for you, if it doesn't exist. Run:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms 'cloudkms:' \
    'projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/root'
```

To constructe the key name parameter above, use the resource name of the [CryptoKey](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys#CryptoKey) object you want to create, following the format:

```
projects/<project-id>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<key-ring-id>/cryptoKeys/<key-id>
```


Once the key is generated, `step` outputs the key's name (including a version number), and the public key PEM:

```
{
  "name": "projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/root/cryptoKeyVersions/1",
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAERcTjeMNjBs29ReA1nf6Odyn2l4Yt\nXPo4CUOcCrn6yw7LJmzaDiqIErhuS9r6BNg92kJvFUiuiU8+w+WZOyhZdw==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
}
```

You'll need this key name for the next step.

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
  We have taken care to provide sane defaults in `step kms create`, but you may wish to change the key type, size, protection level, or other options for your environment. See <Code>step kms help create</Code> for details.
  </div>
</Alert>

Now, let's sign a root CA certificate based on the the key you just created. Substitute the key name output from `step kms create` here:

```shell nocopy
$ step certificate create --profile root-ca \
   --kms 'cloudkms:' \
   --key 'projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/root/cryptoKeyVersions/1' \
   "Smallstep Root CA" root_ca.crt
```

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in root_ca.crt.
```

Great. Next, repeat the process for the Intermediate CA:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms 'cloudkms:' \
    'projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/intermediate'
$ step certificate create --profile intermediate-ca \
   --kms 'cloudkms:' \
   --ca-kms 'cloudkms:' \
   --ca root_ca.crt \
   --ca-key 'projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/root/cryptoKeyVersions/1' \
   --key 'projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/intermediate/cryptoKeyVersions/1' \
   "Smallstep Intermediate CA" intermediate_ca.crt
```

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in intermediate_ca.crt.
```

Now you should have both `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` certificate PEM files.
Use these files in your CA configuration, below.

If you want to run an SSH CA, you also need to create SSH CA key pairs:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms 'cloudkms:' \
    'projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/ssh-user'
$ step kms create --json --kms 'cloudkms:' \
    'projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/ssh-host'
```

### Configuring `step-ca` to use Google Cloud KMS

Next, to configure Cloud KMS in `step-ca`, start with a basic CA configuration created using `step ca init`. Add the `kms` object to your `ca.json` file and replace the property `key` with the Cloud KMS resource name of your intermediate key:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/intermediate/cryptoKeyVersions/1",
    "kms": {
        "type": "cloudkms",
        "uri": "cloudkms:credentials-file=/path/to/gcloud-kms-credentials.json"
    }
}
```

Finally, copy the `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` files into the `root` and `crt` locations:

```shell nocopy
$ cp root_ca.crt intermediate_ca.crt $(step path)/certs
```

Your X.509 CA is ready.

To add SSH support, change the SSH key locations to Cloud KMS resource names for the SSH host and user CA keys:

```json nocopy
{
    "ssh": {
        "hostKey": "projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/ssh-host/cryptoKeyVersions/1",
        "userKey": "projects/smallstep/locations/global/keyRings/step-ca/cryptoKeys/ssh-user/cryptoKeyVersions/1"
    }
}
```

When you start `step-ca`, it prints your X.509 root fingerprint, and the SSH user and host CA keys in SSH key format:

```
2022/09/20 16:28:45 The primary server URL is https://localhost:443
2022/09/20 16:28:45 Root certificates are available at https://localhost:443/roots.pem

```

### Notes on Google Cloud KMS Permissions

Following the principle of least privilege, you'll want to define an IAM operational role for step-ca that limits its access.
See [Google Cloud KMS: Access Control with IAM](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/iam) for an overview.

Here are some notes on granting a custom IAM role that provides step-ca with access to Google Cloud KMS:
* You can constrain the role to the key ring that you created for step-ca.
* For day-to-day operation, grant `step-ca` the following default roles:
  * [`cloudkms.cryptoOperator`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#cloudkms.cryptoOperator)
  * [`cloudkms.viewer`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#cloudkms.viewer)
* More specifically, a running `step-ca` needs access to the following KMS APIs:
  * `resourcemanager.projects.get`
  * `cloudkms.locations.get`
  * `cloudkms.keyRings.get`
  * `cloudkms.cryptoKeys.get`
  * `cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.get`
  * `cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.useToSign`
  * `cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.useToVerify`
  * `cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.useToDecrypt`

## AWS KMS

[AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) is Amazon's managed encryption and key management service. It creates and stores the cryptographic keys and uses AWS infrastructure for signing operations. Amazon KMS operations are always backed by HSMs.

### Creating your PKI in AWS KMS

Please install the [`step kms` plugin](https://github.com/smallstep/step-kms-plugin) before you begin. You'll need it to create your PKI.

Also, make sure you have installed [the `aws` CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and have configured AWS credentials in your local environment.

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
  Avoid storing local AWS credentials in plaintext, if you can. We prefer either <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/step1.html">AWS Identity Center</a> or <a href="https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault">aws-vault</a> for securing local credentials.
  </div>
</Alert>


Next, let's generate a private key for your root CA inside AWS KMS. Run:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms 'awskms:region=us-east-2' root-ca
```

Once the key is generated, `step` outputs the key ID and the public key PEM:

```
{
  "name": "awskms:key-id=78980acd-a42d-4d84-97ba-1e50d3082214",
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEH2ls6h1y2jsXV+IeuhDVkb68zkMe\nKPtI7L6vBIa5ThxOyFaZFnUrGWU6B+KQjProAntgKyNTqOnAh7Eyr3RmgQ==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
}
```

When creating the key, `step kms create` will also add an AWS key alias `root-ca-78980acd` for the key.
The alias is concatenates the key name and the first segment of the key's ID.

You'll need this key name for the next step.

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
  We have taken care to provide sane defaults in `step kms create`, but you may wish to change the key type, size, protection level, or other options for your environment. See <Code>step kms help create</Code> for details.
  </div>
</Alert>

Now, let's sign a root CA certificate based on the the key you just created. Substitute the key name output from `step kms create` here:

```shell nocopy
$ step certificate create --profile root-ca \
   --kms 'awskms:region=us-east-2' \
   --key 'awskms:key-id=78980acd-a42d-4d84-97ba-1e50d3082214' \
   "Smallstep Root CA" root_ca.crt
```

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in root_ca.crt.
```

Great. Next, we'll repeat the process for the Intermediate CA:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms 'awskms:region=us-east-2' intermediate-ca
$ step certificate create --profile intermediate-ca \
   --kms 'awskms:region=us-east-2' \
   --ca-kms 'awskms:region=us-east-2' \
   --ca root_ca.crt \
   --ca-key 'awskms:key-id=78980acd-a42d-4d84-97ba-1e50d3082214' \
   --key 'awskms:key-id=9432458d-1e67-4a74-9a23-8f94708b45fe' \
   "Smallstep Intermediate CA" intermediate_ca.crt
```

Here, the `--ca-key` is the root CA key id; the `--key` is the intermediate CA key id.

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in intermediate_ca.crt.
```

Now you should have both `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` certificate PEM files.
You'll need these files for your CA configuration, below.

If you want to run an SSH CA, you'll also need to create SSH CA key pairs:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms 'awskms:region=us-east-2' ssh-user-ca
$ step kms create --json --kms 'awskms:region=us-east-2' ssh-host-ca
```

Hold onto the key IDs from these commands; you'll need them below.

### Configuring `step-ca` to use AWS KMS

To use `step-ca` with AWS KMS, create a scoped IAM role that has `kms:GetPublicKey` permissions on all of your CA keys, and `kms:Sign` permission on your intermediate CA key.

To configure AWS KMS in your certificate authority, add the `kms` object to `ca.json` and replace the `key` property with the AWS KMS key ID of your intermediate CA key:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "awskms:key-id=f879f239-feb6-4596-9ed2-b1606277c7fe",
    "kms": {
        "type": "awskms",
        "uri": "awskms:region=us-east-2;profile=foo;credentials-file=/path/to/credentials"
    }
}
```

By default, `step-ca` (and, more broadly, AWS's SDK) looks for credentials stored in `~/.aws/credentials`. Use the `credentials-file` option to override. The `region` and `profile` options specify the AWS region and configuration profiles respectively. These options can also be configured using environment variables as described in the [AWS SDK for Go session documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/).

Finally, copy the `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` files into the `root` and `crt` locations:

```shell nocopy
$ cp root_ca.crt intermediate_ca.crt $(step path)/certs
```

Your X.509 CA is ready.

To configure an SSH CA, replace the SSH key locations with the SSH CA keys you created above:

```json nocopy
{
    "ssh": {
        "hostKey": "awskms:key-id=d48e502a-09bc-4bf7-9af8-ae1bccedc931",
        "userKey": "awskms:key-id=cf28e942-1e10-4a08-b84c-5359af1b5f12"
    }
}
```

When you start `step-ca`, it prints your X.509 root fingerprint, and the SSH user and host CA keys in SSH key format:

```
2022/09/20 16:28:45 The primary server URL is https://localhost:443
2022/09/20 16:28:45 Root certificates are available at https://localhost:443/roots.pem
2022/09/20 16:28:45 X.509 Root Fingerprint: b061dfca1013c074244b0f376e5be70b6eb0bd7f21d5438aa3af71fe62b0acf5

### Notes on AWS KMS Permissions

Following the principle of least privilege, you'll want to define an IAM operational role for step-ca that limits its access.
See [Using IAM Policies With AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html) for an overview.

Here are some notes on granting a custom IAM role that provides step-ca with access to AWS KMS:
* You can constrain the role to specific keys that you created for step-ca, by listing each key's ARN in the Resource block of the JSON policy.
* For day-to-day operation, grant `step-ca` the following permissions:
  * `kms:GetPublicKey`
  * `kms:Sign`

## Azure Key Vault

[Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault) is Microsoft's managed key management service.

### Authentication

When using Azure Key Vault with `step-ca`, first authenticate to Azure.

Authentication to Azure is handled via environment variables;
we recommend using either [file-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) via the `AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION` environment variable,
or [using a managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authentication-managed-identity?tabs=azure-cli) and setting the  `AZURE_TENANT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` variables when starting `step-ca`.
Alternatively, you can create a [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli) and set the `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` variables.
See Option 1 under [Authentication Methods for Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authentication?tabs=bash#-option-1-define-environment-variables) for examples of authentication methods and environment variables.

For local development and testing, Azure CLI credentials are used if no authentication environment variables are set.

### Initialize a PKI

To initialize a PKI backed by Azure Key Vault, start by authenticating to Azure using one of the above approaches.
Set the environment variables necessary for authentication to your tenant.

Then, run:

```bash
$ step ca init --kms azurekms
```

This walks you through the process of creating root and intermediate CA signing keys in Key Vault, and configuring the CA to use them.
If you're creating an SSH CA, SSH host and user CA keys are created in Key Vault as well.

### Manual Configuration

To configure an existing CA for Azure Key Vault, or to import an existing Azure Key Vault signing key, add the `kms` object to your `ca.json`, and replace the `key` properties with the key name, vault name, and version of your intermediate (signing) key in Azure Key Vault:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "azurekms:name=intermediate-ca-key;vault=example-vault-0?version=15faf8b8b80d4f1ead067c6383a38b8f&hsm=true",
    "kms": {
        "type": "azurekms"
    }
}
```

* In the `key` URI, the `name` and `vault` refer to the key name and vault name of your intermediate key in Azure Key Vault.
* In the `key` URI, the `version` is the version of the Azure Key Vault key name. Though it is optional, we recommend setting this value explicitly. If omitted, the latest version is used.
* In the `key` URI, the optional `hsm` property can be set to `true` if HSM protection is desired. This is only used when the key is being created by `step-ca`. The default is to use software-protected (non-HSM-backed) keys. See Key Vault's [About Keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys) page for more details.
* In `kms`, an optional `uri` property can be added to provide client credentials (eg. `azurekms:client-id=fooo;client-secret=bar;tenant-id=9de53416-4431-4181-7a8b-23af3EXAMPLE`) instead of using the environment variables described above.

### Notes on Azure Key Vault IAM Permissions

Following the principle of least privilege, you'll want to define an IAM operational role for step-ca that limits its access.
See [Provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based access control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli) for an overview.

Here are some notes on granting a custom IAM role that provides step-ca with access to Azure Key Vault:
* You can constrain the role to the vault that you created for step-ca.
* For day-to-day operation, grant `step-ca` the following default RBAC roles on the vault:
  * Key Vault Crypto User
  * Key Vault Reader
* More specifically, a running `step-ca` needs access to the following APIs:
  * `GetKey`
  * `Sign`

## PKCS #11

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    <strong>The standard `step-ca` binary does not support PKCS #11.</strong><br />
    For PKCS #11 support, you'll need a CGO build of `step-ca`.
    When built with CGO, `step-ca` can call native PKCS #11 C libraries.<br />
    You can either:<br />
    - Build `step-ca` yourself. See <a href="https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-step-ca-using-cgo">Building From Source Using CGO</a>, or<br />
    - Use the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/smallstep/step-ca">`step-ca:hsm`</a> Docker image. The `hsm` tag is built with CGO.<br />
  </div>
</Alert>

A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a specialized piece of hardware that is designed to generate and store private keys, and sign messages using those keys.
The private keys on an HSM cannot be exported from the device.
One can only run signing operations using the key.
This is an excellent way to protect private keys for a Certificate Authority,
which in normal operation simply needs to be able to sign Certificate Signing Requests.
 
[Public-Key Cryptography Standards #11 (PKCS #11)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_11) is the most common platform-independent API used to access HSM hardware.
It's supported by most HSM hardware, like Yubico's [YubiHSM2](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubihsm-2/), and the [Nitrokey HSM 2](https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nk-hsm-2-nitrokey-hsm-2-7).
There's also a software-based "HSM," [SoftHSMv2](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2), which offers a PKCS #11 interface without the hardware.

### 0. Before you begin

Your HSM may need to be prepared before you can initialize a PKI on it.
Preparation steps depend on the device and are beyond the scope of this documentation.
For example, with YubiHSM2, first create an authentication key with appropriate capabiliites.

Plan how you will backup and restore your CA keys, for offline storage.

The `step kms` plugin will create CA keys and sign certificates on your device.
To use it, you'll need to provide a PKCS #11 URI for accessing the device, using the `--kms` flag.

Here are some examples of PKCS #11 URIs for accessing various devices in Linux:

HSM                        | URI format
-------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YubiHSM2                   | `pkcs11:module-path=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/yubihsm_pkcs11.so;token=YubiHSM`
AWS CloudHSM               | `pkcs11:module-path=/opt/cloudhsm/lib/libcloudhsm_pkcs11.so;token=cavium?pin-value=$HSM_USER:$HSM_PASSWORD`
SoftHSM                    | `pkcs11:module-path=/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so;token=token1?pin-value=$HSM_PASSWORD`
nCipher nShield            | `pkcs11:module-path=/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so;token=rjk?pin-source=/etc/step-ca/hsm-pin.txt`

Substitute `$HSM_USER` and `$HSM_PASSWORD` with your own values.

In this URI,
* `module-path` points to your PKCS #11 `.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib` library file,
* `token` is the label (`CKA_LABEL`) of the HSM you're using,
* `pin-value` contains hardcoded HSM credentials. It may be a PIN, username and password, password, or a filename. The YubiHSM2 is special in that the PIN value is the concatenation of the four-digit authorization key ID (eg. `0001`) and the PIN.
* Or, `pin-source` is a filename containing HSM credentials.

### 1. Create your PKI

Once you've constructed the right URI for accessing your device, use it in place of `$PKCS_URI` in the commands below.

First, please install the [`step kms` plugin](https://github.com/smallstep/step-kms-plugin) before you begin. You'll need it to create your PKI.

Next, let's ask the device to generate a private key for your root CA. Run:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms "$PKCS_URI" "pkcs11:id=7331;object=root-ca"
```

Once the key is generated, `step` will output the key ID and the public key PEM:

```
{
  "name": "pkcs11:id=7331;object=root-ca",
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEH2ls6h1y2jsXV+IeuhDVkb68zkMe\nKPtI7L6vBIa5ThxOyFaZFnUrGWU6B+KQjProAntgKyNTqOnAh7Eyr3RmgQ==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
}
```

You'll need this key name for the next step.

Now, let's sign a root CA certificate based on the the key you just created. Substitute the key name output from `step kms create` here:

```shell nocopy
$ step certificate create --profile root-ca \
   --kms "$PKCS_URI"
   --key "pkcs11:id=7331;object=root-ca" \
   "Smallstep Root CA" root_ca.crt
```

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in root_ca.crt.
```

Great. Next, we'll repeat the process for the Intermediate CA:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms "$PKCS_URI" "pkcs11:id=7332;object=intermediate-ca"
$ step certificate create --profile intermediate-ca \
   --kms "$PKCS_URI" \
   --ca-kms "$PKCS_URI" \
   --ca root_ca.crt \
   --ca-key "pkcs11:id=7331;object=root-ca" \
   --key "pkcs11:id=7332;object=intermediate-ca" \
   "Smallstep Intermediate CA" intermediate_ca.crt
```

Here, the `--ca-key` is the root CA key id; the `--key` is the intermediate CA key id.

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in intermediate_ca.crt.
```

Now you should have both `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` certificate PEM files.
You'll need these files for your CA configuration, below.

If you want to run an SSH CA, you'll also need to create SSH CA key pairs:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json --kms "$PKCS_URI" "pkcs11:id=7333;object=ssh-host-ca"
$ step kms create --json --kms "$PKCS_URI" "pkcs11:id=7334;object=ssh-user-ca"
```

Hold onto the key IDs from these commands; you'll need them below.

### Configuring `step-ca` to use PKCS #11

One you've created your PKI on the HSM using `step-kms-plugin`, you'll need to configure `step-ca` to use the HSM.

To configure your certificate authority, add the `kms` object to `ca.json` and replace the `key` property with the object ID of your intermediate CA key:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "pkcs11:id=7332;object=intermediate-ca",
    "kms": {
        "type": "pkcs11",
        "uri": "$PKCS_URI"
    }
}
```

Finally, copy the `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` files into the `root` and `crt` locations:

```shell nocopy
$ cp root_ca.crt intermediate_ca.crt $(step path)/certs
```

Your X.509 CA is ready.

To configure an SSH CA, replace the SSH key locations with the SSH CA keys you created above:

```json nocopy
{
    "ssh": {
        "hostKey": "pkcs11:id=7333;object=ssh-host-ca",
        "userKey": "pkcs11:id=7334;object=ssh-user-ca"
    }
}
```

When you start `step-ca`, you will see your X.509 root fingerprint, and the SSH user and host CA keys in SSH key format:

## TPM 2.0

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    <strong>The standard `step-ca` binary does not support TPM 2.0.</strong><br />
    For native TPM 2.0 support, you'll need a CGO build of `step-ca`.
    When built with CGO, `step-ca` can call native Yubico C libraries.<br />
    You can either:<br />
    - Build `step-ca` yourself. See <a href="https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-step-ca-using-cgo">Building From Source Using CGO</a>, or<br />
    - Use the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/smallstep/step-ca">`step-ca:hsm`</a> Docker image. The `hsm` tag is built with CGO.<br />
  </div>
</Alert>

You can leverage a TPM 2.0 chip to store your CA key and sign TLS certificates.

### Prerequisites and Caveats

* To enable TPM 2.0 support in `step-ca`, you must follow our [Instructions for building from source using CGO](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-step-ca-using-cgo)
* You will need a TPM 2.0 chip and (on Linux) the [`tpm2-tss` package](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss)
* You can use the TPM for X.509 CAs
* Please install the [`step kms` plugin](https://github.com/smallstep/step-kms-plugin) before you begin. You'll need it to create your PKI.

First, let's generate your Root CA on disk.
After this tutorial, you will only need the root private key if you issue another Intermediate CA.

Run:

```shell nocopy
$ step certificate create --profile root-ca \
    "Smallstep Root CA" \
    root_ca.crt \
    root_ca.key
```

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in root_ca.crt.
Your private key has been saved in root_ca.key.
```

Great.
For a production PKI,
it is recommended that you create this key on an airgapped device with secure backups.

Next, we'll create an Intermediate CA key on the TPM,
and sign an Intermediate CA certificate:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json 'tpmkms:name=my-intermediate-ca'
$ step certificate create --profile intermediate-ca \
   --kms 'tpmkms:' \
   --ca root_ca.crt \
   --ca-key root_ca.key \
   --key 'tpmkms:name=my-intermediate-ca' \
   "Smallstep Intermediate CA" intermediate_ca.crt
```

Here, the `--ca-key` is your root CA; the `--key` is the intermediate CA key id.

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in intermediate_ca.crt.
```

Now you should have both `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` certificate PEM files.
You no longer need your `root_ca.key`, so you can now store it in a safe place.

Finally, to enable your CA in `ca.json`, point the `root` and `crt` options to the generated certificates, replace the `key` option with the TPM KMS URI:

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "tpmkms:name=my-intermediate-ca",
    "kms": {
        "type": "tpmkms",
        "uri": "tpmkms:"
    }
}
```

Finally, copy the `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` files into the `root` and `crt` locations:

```shell nocopy
$ cp root_ca.crt intermediate_ca.crt $(step path)/certs
```

Your X.509 CA is ready. When you start `step-ca`, it prints your X.509 root fingerprint:

```
2022/09/20 16:28:45 The primary server URL is https://localhost:443
2022/09/20 16:28:45 Root certificates are available at https://localhost:443/roots.pem
2022/09/20 16:28:45 X.509 Root Fingerprint: b061dfca1013c074244b0f376e5be70b6eb0bd7f21d5438aa3af71fe62b0acf5

## YubiKey PIV

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
    <strong>The standard `step-ca` binary does not support YubiKey PIV.</strong><br />
    For YubiKey PIV support, you'll need a CGO build of `step-ca`.
    When built with CGO, `step-ca` can call native Yubico C libraries.<br />
    You can either:<br />
    - Build `step-ca` yourself. See <a href="https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-step-ca-using-cgo">Building From Source Using CGO</a>, or<br />
    - Use the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/smallstep/step-ca">`step-ca:hsm`</a> Docker image. The `hsm` tag is built with CGO.<br />
  </div>
</Alert>

You can leverage a hardware [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/)—and the [YubiKey PIV application](https://www.yubico.com/authentication-standards/smart-card/)—to store your CA keys and sign TLS and SSH certificates.

### Prerequisites and Caveats

* To enable YubiKey support in `step-ca`, you must follow our [Instructions for building from source using CGO](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-step-ca-using-cgo)
* You will need a YubiKey 5 series device that [supports the PIV application](https://www.yubico.com/store/compare/)
* [Certificate slots](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/Certificate_slots.html) 9a, 9c, 9d, 9e, and 82-95 are supported
* You can use the YubiKey for X.509 and SSH CAs

Please install the [`step kms` plugin](https://github.com/smallstep/step-kms-plugin) before you begin. You'll need it to create your PKI.

Now, insert your YubiKey.
Let's generate a private key for your root CA in slot 82 on the YubiKey.
Run:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json 'yubikey:slot-id=82'
```

Once the key is generated, `step` outputs the key name and public key PEM:

```
{
  "name": "yubikey:slot-id=82",
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAED3T/7q+p+6239Ri35TBVoChM6VNq\n1buLfql1acRl7F2qf/L96x9XHY5GHoqYNCAm/ocL9hTl8ytWJao+JSNE+Q==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
}
```

<Alert severity="info">
  <div>
  We have taken care to provide sane defaults in `step kms create`, but you may wish to change the key type, size, or other options for your environment. See <Code>step kms help create</Code> for details.
  </div>
</Alert>

Now, let's sign a root CA certificate based on the the key you just created. Substitute the key name output from `step kms create` here:

```shell nocopy
$ step certificate create --profile root-ca \
   --kms 'yubikey:pin-value=123456' \
   --key 'yubikey:slot-id=82' \
   "Smallstep Root CA" root_ca.crt
```

Here we're using the default PIN code of 123456 to access the YubiKey.

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in root_ca.crt.
```

Great. Next, we'll repeat the process for the Intermediate CA:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json 'yubikey:slot-id=83'
$ step certificate create --profile intermediate-ca \
   --kms 'yubikey:pin-value=123456' \
   --ca-kms 'yubikey:pin-value=123456' \
   --ca root_ca.crt \
   --ca-key 'yubikey:slot-id=82' \
   --key 'yubikey:slot-id=83' \
   "Smallstep Intermediate CA" intermediate_ca.crt
```

Here, the `--ca-key` is the root CA key id; the `--key` is the intermediate CA key id.

Output:

```
Your certificate has been saved in intermediate_ca.crt.
```

Now you should have both `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` certificate PEM files.
You'll need these files for your CA configuration, below.

for safekeeping, you may wish to import the certificates into the YubiKey. To do this, you'll need Yubico's [`ykman` CLI utility](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/). Run:

```shell nocopy
$ ykman piv certificates import 82 root_ca.crt
$ ykman piv certificates import 83 intermediate_ca.crt
```

(While `step-ca` won't use these copies of the certificates, you can always use `ykman piv certificates export` to download the certificates later.)

Next, if you want to run an SSH CA, you'll also need to create two SSH CA keys:

```shell nocopy
$ step kms create --json 'yubikey:slot-id=84'
$ step kms create --json 'yubikey:slot-id=85'
```

Finally, to enable your CA in `ca.json`, point the `root` and `crt` options to the generated certificates, replace the `key` option with the YubiKey URI generated in the previous part, and configure the `kms` option with the appropriate `type` and `pin`.

```json nocopy
{
    "root": "/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt",
    "crt": "/etc/step-ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt",
    "key": "yubikey:slot-id=83",
    "kms": {
        "type": "yubikey",
        "uri": "yubikey:management-key=01020304...?pin-value=123456"
    }
}
```

Finally, copy the `root_ca.crt` and `intermediate_ca.crt` files into the `root` and `crt` locations:

```shell nocopy
$ cp root_ca.crt intermediate_ca.crt $(step path)/certs
```

Your X.509 CA is ready.

To configure an SSH CA, replace the SSH key locations with the SSH CA keys you created in AWS KMS:

```json nocopy
{
    "ssh": {
        "hostKey": "yubikey:slot-id=84",
        "userKey": "yubikey:slot-id=85"
    }
}
```

When you start `step-ca`, it prints your X.509 root fingerprint, and the SSH host and user CA keys in SSH key format:

```

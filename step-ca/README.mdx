## Introduction to `step-ca`

`step-ca` is an online Certificate Authority (CA) for secure, automated X.509 and SSH certificate management. 
It's the server counterpart to [`step` CLI](../step-cli).
It is secured with TLS,
and it offers several configurable certificate provisioners, flexible certificate templating, and pluggable database backends to suit a wide variety of contexts and workflows.
It employs sane default algorithms and attributes,
so you don't have to be a security engineer to use it securely.

Teams use `step-ca` to:
- Generate TLS certificates for private infrastructure using the ACME protocol.
- Automate TLS certificate renewal.
- Add Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) support to a legacy subordinate CA.
- Issue short-lived SSH certificates via OAuth OIDC single sign on.
- Issue customized X.509 and SSH certificates.
- and much more ...

## Features

### X.509 Certificate Authority

`step-ca` issues X.509 certificates for use with TLS, mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, document signing, and X.509 authentication more broadly.
With `step-ca`, you can:

- Automate certificate issuance and renewal for clients, servers, and Kubernetes workloads.
- Issue certificates to humans, e.g., using Single Sign-on (OpenID Connect) for authentication.
- Choose key types (RSA, ECDSA and EdDSA) and lifetimes to suit your needs.
- Issue [short-lived certificates](https://smallstep.com/blog/passive-revocation.html) with automated enrollment, renewal, and passive revocation.
- Operate [an online intermediate CA](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/intermediate-ca-new-ca) on an existing root CA, eg. to add support for ACME to an existing PKI.
- Operate a local [Registration Authority (RA)](./registration-authority-ra-mode.mdx) on an internal network or inside a Kubernetes cluster that authorizes certificate requests for an upstream `step-ca` server.
- Deploy a high availability (HA) Certificate Authority using [root federation](https://smallstep.com/blog/step-v0.8.3-federation-root-rotation.html) and/or multiple intermediaries.


### SSH Certificate Authority

`step-ca` is capable of issuing SSH certificates to users and hosts. Delegate SSH authentication to `step-ca` and set up a transparent chain of trust for authorized access.

- Avoid the risk of trust-on-first-use (TOFU) when connecting to SSH hosts.
- Issue a short-lived SSH user certificate via [Single Sign-on](https://smallstep.com/blog/diy-single-sign-on-for-ssh/).

### Provisioners

Provisioners are methods of using the CA to get certificates for humans or machines.
They offer different modes of authorization for the CA.

For example, you can have your CA issue certificates in exchange for:
- [ACME challenge responses](../tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients.mdx) from any ACMEv2 client
- [OAuth OIDC single sign-on tokens](https://smallstep.com/blog/easily-curl-services-secured-by-https-tls.html), e.g.:
  - ID tokens from Okta, Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID and Auth0
  - ID tokens from an OAuth OIDC service you host, like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex)
- [Cloud instance identity documents](https://smallstep.com/blog/embarrassingly-easy-certificates-on-aws-azure-gcp/) for VMs on AWS, GCP, and Azure
- [Single-use, short-lived JWK tokens](./provisioners.mdx#jwk), e.g., issued by your CD tool — Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Terraform, etc.

### Templates

[X.509 Templates](./templates.mdx#x509-templates) let you customize certificate fields, e.g.:
- Add custom Subject Alternative Names (SANs) or non-standard X.509 Object Identifiers (OIDs) to certificates.
- Restrict certificates by domain name or key size.
- Issue CA certificates with longer path lengths for multiple intermediaries.

`step-ca` ships with several built-in templates for everyday operations,
and you can use Golang's `text/template` syntax to create new templates.

### Cryptographic Protection

For strong protection of your CA signing keys, we've built [`step-ca` integrations](./configuration.mdx#cryptographic-protection) for PKCS #11 HSMs, Google Cloud KMS, AWS KMS, and YubiKey PIV, among others.

### Other Integrations

`step-ca` plays well with Kubernetes cert-manager and Envoy Secret Discovery Service. For more information, see [Integrations](./integrations.mdx).

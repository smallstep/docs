In this guide,
we'll talk about different approaches you can take
as you build your device inventory in Smallstep.

It's worth restating the overall goal of this process:
To build a high-assurance device inventory,
so that only your organization's devices
can access protected resources.

While many organizations
have device inventories in various locations
(IT Asset Management systems, device management platforms, etc),
these are not usually high-assurance inventories.
Smallstep uses hardware identifiers
and device attestation
to help you develop a high-assurance inventory
that can be the foundation for device authentication.

Here's a few ways to bring high-assurance device identifiers
into your Smallstep inventory:

### Manual self-enrollment

You can [manually invite users
to join your Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/users/invite),
and they will be able to self-enroll devices
using the [Smallstep Desktop App](./smallstep-app.mdx)
or the [Smallstep Agent for Linux](./smallstep-agent.mdx).

By default, administrators
must approve a new device
before it can access any of your resources.
You can change this in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### IdP self-enrollment via SSO

This option requires IdP self-enrollment in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team) to be enabled.
It is disabled by default.

With IdP self-enrollment enabled,
when you connect Smallstep to your identity provider,
your users will be able to self-enroll
via single sign-on,
using the [Smallstep Desktop App](./smallstep-app.mdx)
or the [Smallstep Agent](./smallstep-agent.mdx).

By default, administrators
must approve newly-enrolled devices
before they can access any of your resources.
You can change this in [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team).

### Sync Smallstep to an MDM

You can sync your existing MDM inventories into Smallstep.
Once an MDM is synced,
you can deploy the Smallstep Agent to your endpoints
to enable high-assurance protections.

Devices synced from an MDM inventory
are not automatically approved,
and they will not be marked as high-assurance
until Smallstep receives an attestation from the device.

For a concrete example,
see [Connect Jamf Pro to Smallstep](../tutorials/connect-jamf-pro-to-smallstep.mdx)

### Add devices via API

You can import devices from any source into Smallstep using our API.

Devices added via API are automatically approved.
but they will not be marked as high-assurance
until Smallstep receives an attestation from the device.

#### Example: I have a list of device identifiers

For each device, use the [Add Device](https://gateway.smallstep.com/v2025-01-01/operations/PostDevices) endpoint to create a device.

Devices are automatically approved when added via API.

Once added,
you'll see devices in the Smallstep console,
under [Devices](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/devices).

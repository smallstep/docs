  Understand how Smallstep Certificate Manager works and if it’s appropriate to
  your use case.
---

Certificates power modern software. Kubernetes, service meshes, containers,
microservices, distributed databases & queues, configuration management &
orchestration systems, BeyondCorp proxies, and secure software supply chains all
use certificates. Organizations running modern infrastructure make extensive use
of certificates, whether they're aware of it or not.

For many organizations, this is a blind spot, with long-lived certificates
issued manually or from poorly secured deploy pipelines. Secure, reliable
certificate management requires automation. Smallstep Certificate Manager is a
flexible, extensible toolchain with all of the server and client-side components
you'll need to solve this problem, carefully designed to be operationally
simple, easy to use, and hard to misuse.

Certificate Manager builds on two open source projects, maintained by smallstep:

- `step-ca`: a private online certificate authority for secure automated
  certificate management.
- `step`: a general-purpose cryptography toolkit and the client-side counterpart
  to `step-ca`.

## Core Concepts & Components {#core-concepts}

### Certificates, CAs, Subjects, Endpoints, and Relying Parties

A **certificate** is a sort of credential. Concretely, a certificate is a data
structure that contains a name, public key, validity period (a.k.a., lifetime),
and additional metadata. Certificates are **signed** by a trusted **certificate
authority** (CA) and issued to **endpoints**. A **relying party** validates a
certificate and extracts the **subject name** to authenticate the identity of an
endpoint.

## Endpoints

An **Endpoint** is an entity (person, device, workload) that is issued a
certificate. Certificate Manager attempts to group certificate renewals for an
Endpoint for alerting, audit, and billing purposes.

Certificate Manager can be configured to alert you when an Endpoint’s last
certificate is approaching expiry and has not been renewed.

The Certificate Manager dashboard provides an Endpoint detail view that makes it
easy for administrators to view the historical certificate lineage for an
Endpoint. This aggregated view simplifies operations, auditing, reporting, and
compliance inquiries.

Certificate Manager billing is also metered on Endpoint-months.

- Billing starts when a certificate is issued for a new Endpoint
- Billing ends when an Endpoint’s last certificate expires or is revoked

Billing per-certificate would penalize deployments that use short-lived
certificates and automated renewal. Endpoint billing is designed to encourage
this best practice.

Two Endpoint examples:

1. A single device with **one 30-day certificate** would be billed at the same
   rate as,
2. A single device with **60 one-day certificates** renewed every 12-hours.

**Endpoint** grouping is automatic and intuitive for most use cases:

- For provisioners with renewal enabled:
  - Certificates issued using `step ca certificate` (or any other method that
    uses the `/sign` API) create a new Endpoint
  - Certificates issued using `step ca renew` (or any other method that uses the
    `/renew` API) are associated with the existing Endpoint of the certificate
    that’s being renewed
- For provisioners with renewal disabled, common with ACME and OIDC,
  certificates with identical subjects (common name and SANs), ignoring order
  and capitalization, belong to the same Endpoint

For billing purposes, there is a limit of three active certificates per
Endpoint. Each active certificate above three is billed as an additional
Endpoint. To avoid being charged for multiple Endpoints you can revoke unused
certificates after they’ve been renewed.

If you’d like to opt-in to certificate-based billing, inquire about high-volume
fixed pricing, or have any other questions about Endpoint-based billing for your
use case please [contact us](mailto:support@smallstep.com).

## Authorities

Certificate Manager **authorities** are trusted services that manage certificate
issuance and revocation. Several authority types are supported. Authorities are
highly configurable, and multiple authorities can be used together to meet
complex requirements.

### Issuing Authorities

An **issuing authority** is an online certificate authority that authenticates
and authorizes certificate requests and issues certificates. Issuing authorities
sign certificates themselves. To do so, they are provisioned with a special CA
certificate and private key.

There are two types of issuing authority:

1. **Hosted**: run by smallstep on your behalf as part of your Certificate
   Manager account.
2. **Linked**: an instance of `step-ca` you run that connects to your
   Certificate Manager account for reporting, alerting, revocation, and other
   managed services.

If an issuing authority's private key is compromised, it can be used to
maliciously issue certificates that will be trusted by the rest of your
infrastructure. To protect these keys, `step-ca` integrates with hardware and
software key managers, including PKCS#11 Hardware Security Modules (HSMs),
YubiKeys, and cloud key management systems (KMSs) from AWS, GCP, and Azure. For
hosted authorities, smallstep secures these keys for you in GCP's CloudKMS, with
options for software or FIPS 140-2 Level 3 hardware protection levels.

### Root vs. Intermediate Certificate Authorities

A **root CA** is _directly_ trusted by relying parties. The root CA's
certificate must be deployed to VMs, devices, and containers, then software and
systems must be configured to trust it. We'll see how this is done later when we
discuss _bootstrapping trust_.

An **intermediate CA** (also called a **subordinate CA**) is issued a special
certificate that authorizes it to sign other certificates. Endpoint certificates
can be signed directly by the root or, more typically, by an intermediate CA
that recursively _chains up_ to the root CA. An intermediate CA allows you to
keep your root signing keys offline, which improves security.

For most scenarios, this is a nuance you won't have to worry about. By default,
Certificate Manager will create a non-issuing root CA and a separate issuing
authority for you automatically. For advanced scenarios, you can use your own
offline root CA, provision multiple issuing authorities from a single root,
configure multiple levels of intermediates, and revoke and re-issue intermediate
authority certificates as necessary.

### Registration Authorities

Like an issuing authority, a **registration authority** is an online service
that accepts and authenticates certificate requests. But, instead of issuing
certificates itself, a registration authority passes authentic requests to an
issuing authority to sign. Registration authorities support all Provisioner
types and are an optional component. They deliver most of the benefits of a
linked issuing authority with less operational complexity since there's no
signing key to manage.

![ACME Registration Authority](/graphics/ia-cloud-ra-challenge-client.svg 'In this example, the Smallstep ACME RA runs within the local network or VPC and responds to ACME requests from internal infrastructure and workloads. The RA accepts ACME orders and authenticates requests by verifying an ACME challenge. Upon verification, a CSR is securely passed to the Issuing Authority to sign and catalog.')

### Validation Authorities

A **validation authority** distributes certificate revocation status. Validation
authorities implement two open standards to support active revocation:

- **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**: a signed, immutable ledger that lists
  the serial number of all revoked certificates. CRLs are signed by trusted
  infrastructure and served from cloud storage for high performance and
  availability.
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**: a standard API for requesting
  the revocation status of a particular certificate. The Certificate Manager
  OCSP responder is a shared-nothing service that uses CRLs as a data source.

### Provisioners

**Provisioners** are used by issuing authorities to authenticate certificate
requests. Provisioners make it easy to automate certificate management where
possible, and support semi-automated / self-serve workflows where required.

Certificate lifetimes, access control policies, renewal, templates, and many
other options are configurable per-provisioner. Since an issuing authority can
have multiple provisioners, you implement complex authentication and
authorization policies and issue different kinds of certificates from one
issuing authority.

Some of the more popular workflows provisioners enable include:

- **Passwords**: in its simplest form, the `JWK` provisioner can be used to get
  a certificate using a password. We'll see an example of this below.
- **One-time tokens**: the `JWK` provisioner also supports one-time tokens using
  [`step ca token`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/token),
  which can be generated by orchestration or configuration management and passed
  to a container or host to obtain a certificate.
- **ACME**: the `ACME` provisioner implements the
  [ACME standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) created by
  Let's Encrypt. It can be used to automatically get a certificate for a domain
  name or IP address. A rich client ecosystem and built-in support in many tools
  makes ACME easy to integrate. See the
  [ACME documentation](./acme/README.mdx) to learn more.
- **Single Sign-on**: The `OIDC` provisioner uses
  [OAuth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and
  [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
  to get a certificate using single sign-on via Google, Okta, Azure AD, or any
  other compatible identity provider. See the
  [OIDC documentation](./oidc.mdx) to learn more. There are
  two common scenarios where this is useful:
  1. **Authenticating users** (engineers, operators, etc.) who need a
     certificate for code signing or to authenticate to databases, services, or
     other infrastructure using mutual TLS.
  2. **Self-serve / semi-automated** workflows for administrators to obtain
     certificates for workloads, devices, and other infrastructure, where
     automation is not possible.
- **Cloud VMs**: the `IID` provisioner can be used to get certificates to your
  VMs running on AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- **Kubernetes**:
  - [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) is a popular ACME
    client for Kubernetes. It creates
    [certificate secret resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets)
    that can be used by containers and ingresses.
    [`step-issuer`](https://github.com/smallstep/step-issuer) lets you connect
    `cert-manager` to an issuing authority.
  - [autocert](https://github.com/smallstep/autocert) lets you use pod
    annotations to automatically inject certificates into containers using
    volume mounts.
  - The `k8ssa` provisioner lets you get certificates using Kubernetes service
    accounts.
- **Devices**: The `X5C` and `SSHPOP` provisioners let you get a certificate
  using an existing x509 or SSH certificate issued from another authority. This
  can be used by devices to exchange long-lived _birth certificates_ issued at
  manufacture time for short-lived _workload certificates_ and for other
  _derived credential_ workflows where a certificate from a canonical CA is used
  to automatically obtain certificates from one or more special-purpose CA(s).

## Certificate Lifecycle Management

### Bootstrapping Trust

Before issuing a certificate, your software and systems must be configured to
trust your authorities. More precisely, you need to configure everything to
trust your _root certificate_ (i.e., the certificate that belongs to your root
CA). You can include your root certificate in base images, distribute it using
configuration management, or use
[`step ca bootstrap`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/bootstrap)
or [`step ca root`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/root) to
securely download your root certificate from an issuing authority. You can also
download the root certificate for your authorities from the Certificate Manager
dashboard.

- [`step ca bootstrap`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/bootstrap)
  configures `step` to trust your root CA and use a particular issuing
  authority.
- [`step ca root`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/root)
  securely downloads your root certificate.

Once you've downloaded your root certificate, you can add it to your system
trust store using
[`step certificate install`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/install):

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca root root.crt
The root certificate has been saved in root.crt.

$ step certificate install root.crt
Password:
Certificate r.crt has been installed.
X.509v3 Root CA Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 1829...9147]
  Subject:     Root CA
  Issuer:      Root CA
  Valid from:  2020-09-18T20:55:03Z
          to:  2030-09-16T20:55:03Z
```

Or configure software to trust it (see
[Hello mTLS](https://smallstep.com/hello-mtls) for more examples):

```shell-session nocopy
$ cat nginx.conf
server {
    listen                 443 ssl;
    server_name            myserver.internal.net;
    ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/client_certs/root.crt;
    ssl_verify_client      optional;
    location / {
      if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
        return 403;
      }
    }
}
```

### Issuing Certificates

**Issuing** a certificate using `step` is simple. In it's most basic form, the
[`step ca certificate`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/certificate)
command provides simple interactive workflows for people to get a certificate
from an issuing authority. Flags and options make scripting and other
non-interactive workflows easy. We'll use several variations of this command in
the examples below.

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca certificate example.com example.crt example.key
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
What provisioner key do you want to use?
  ▸ mike@example.com (JWK) [kid: -6v0dwnSlz2D5opq-B5prQmyD9DhzdJSHMidiu1TjYg]
    sshpop (SSHPOP)
    x5c (X5C)
    Google (OIDC) [client: 650445034027-jsjdrkiskeq9ke99ud2rqkst82ft8uch.apps.googleusercontent.com]
✔ Provisioner: mike@smallstep.com (JWK) [kid: -6v0dwnSlz2D5opq-B5prQmyD9DhzdJSHMidiu1TjYg]
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
✔ CA: https://ca.example.com
✔ Certificate: example.crt
✔ Private Key: example.key
```

### Templates

**Templates** give you granular control over certificate details. By default,
Certificate Manager is tuned to issue short-lived certificates for use with TLS.
Templates let you customize every detail of a certificate, down to the
[OID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier), to support any use case.

Concretely, a template is a JSON representation of a certificate that's
materialized using Go's [`text/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
module and [sprig functions](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/). They look
like this:

![Certificate Templates](/graphics/templates-screenshot.svg 'Certificate Templates')

Context from certificate requests and authentication credentials are made
available as template variables, so you can adjust certificate details based on
who's requesting the certificate.

### Inventories

**Inventories** are lists of hosts, services, people, or any other endpoint. An
inventory record lets you associate metadata with an endpoint. Inventories work
together with templates. An inventory lookup can be triggered by a certificate
request. Metadata is exposed as template variables, where it can be used to
customize certificates or authorize certificate requests.

For example, you can use inventories to map the email address from an OIDC
identity token to a username, authorize a host to get certificates for its
workloads, or map an authenticated device ID from a TPM attestation certificate
to a DNS name.

### Renewal

Certificates expire. Certificate Manager makes renewing a certificate ahead of
expiration easy. Renewals are authenticated using your existing certificate, and
produce an identical certificate with a new serial number and extended lifetime.

In its most primitive form, renewal is a simple single-command operation:

```shell-session nocopy
step ca renew svc.crt svc.key
```

More than a dozen command-line flags make
[`step ca renew`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/renew)
flexible and easy to integrate into almost any operational environment. For a
taste of what's possible, consider:

```shell-session nocopy
step ca renew --daemon --exec "nginx -s reload" svc.crt svc.key
```

The `--daemon` flag starts a long-running process that will continuously renew
`svc.crt` after 2/3 of its lifetime has elapsed. The `--exec "nginx -s reload"`
option tells Nginx to reload `svc.crt` after each renewal. We even take care of
retries if renewal fail (with exponential backoff and jitter to mitigate denial
of service issues and thundering herds).

`step ca renew` is designed to integrate nicely with `cron` or `systemd`, which
is what we recommend for production deploys. For more details see our
[documentation on production-ready automated renewal](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/certificate-authority-server-production#renewal-using-systemd-timers).

It's also common to trigger renewal from configuration management or from a
container sidecar. Regardless, `step` makes renewal simple and secure.

#### Disabling Renewal

Finally, sometimes you _don't_ want certificates to be renewed. For example, if
you're issuing certificates using single sign-on (the `OIDC` provisioner), you
probably want your users to re-authenticate with your identity provider
periodically to get a new certificate instead of renewing. Renewal can be
enabled and disabled per-provisioner to accommodate this (it's disabled by
default for the `OIDC` provisioner).

#### Renewal After Expiry

* This is an Advanced Authority feature

Some use cases demand an option to renew expired certificates.
For example, intermittently-connected devices may not be able to reach the CA in time for a renewal.
The ability to renew expired certificates can be enabled on a per-provisioner basis.
Enable it in the Smallstep dashboard when you create a new provisioner,
or on the command line for an existing provisioner.
While sometimes necessary, this feature comes with risks and is disabled by default.

### Revocation

Certificates should be revoked if they're compromised or no longer needed.
Smallstep Certificate Manager supports both _passive_ and _active_ revocation.

  * **Passive revocation** disables renewal for a particular certificate. The certificate will be trusted until it expires.
  * **Active revocation** explicitly invalidates a certificate ahead of expiry. CRL and OCSP are used to distribute revocation status to relying parties. Active revocation is often necessary for incident response. However, caching, availability, and configuration challenges can make active revocation unreliable. For systems that support it, we've found that revoking authorization can be easier to implement and more reliable than active certificate revocation. We've covered this topic in more detail [on our blog](https://smallstep.com/blog/passive-revocation/).

#### Using Passive Revocation

Passive revocation is on by default and works well in conjunction with short-lived certificates.
To revoke a certificate, run `step ca revoke` and pass the certificate's serial number.

```bash
$ step ca revoke 31952909121245729293840904958100006722
```

Once revoked, the certificate is no longer renewable.

#### Using Active Revocation

Active revocation (CRL and OCSP) is available if you're using an Advanced Authority.
It can be enabled when you create the authority.
To revoke a certificate, you will need either the certificate and its private key (for mutual TLS), or a JWK provisioner (for JWT authentication).
You cannot revoke a certificate using the default administrative OIDC provisioner.

To revoke a certificate using mutual TLS, run:

```bash
$ step ca revoke --cert example.crt --key example.key
```

With a JWK provisioner, to revoke a certificate using JWT authentication, run:

```bash
$ SERIAL=31952909121245729293840904958100006722
$ TOKEN=$(step ca token --provisioner jwk-provisioner --revoke $SERIAL)
$ step ca revoke --token $TOKEN $SERIAL
```

### Observability & Alerting

Certificate Manager is designed to support large, rapidly evolving
infrastructures. In these environments, it's easy for a small, unnoticed failure
to cascade into a large outage.

Certificate Manager can alert you ahead of certificate expiry via email or by
calling a webhook. Alerts can be fed into your SIEM or sent to slack so you can
remediate ahead of an outage. Issued certificates are catalogued for easy
auditability. The Certificate Manager interface allows you to sort and filter,
and quickly list and export certificate subjects, issue & expiry dates, issuing
authority, provisioner, and other certificate details.

### Smallstep API

The Smallstep API can be used to manage your authorities programmatically.
The API is currently an alpha release with limited availability.
Request access to this API for your account by [creating a support ticket](https://support.smallstep.com/kb-tickets/new) for our Customer Engineering team. Be sure to include your team name in your request.

## Certificate Manager in Action

Let's look at how these features come together in a few common workflows.

To configure `step` to use our authority, run:

```shell-session nocopy
step ca bootstrap \
  --ca-url https://prod.yourco.ca.smallstep.com
  --fingerprint 6d04ff00618125114b97870f835c4a28fce2fec91e4b86946147f5c6a5555ff8
```

### Simple Password-based Issuance

To get a certificate, run `step ca certificate`. You'll be prompted to select a
provisioner. In this example, we'll use the `JWK` provisioner in a
password-based flow:

```shell-session nocopy
 $ step ca certificate admin@yourco.com --san=any-name any.crt any.key
✔ Provisioner: pass (JWK) [kid: x6v0dwnSlz2D5opq-B5prQmyD9DhzdJSHMidiu1TjYg]
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
✔ CA: https://prod.yourco.ca.smallstep.com
✔ Certificate: any.crt
✔ Private Key: any.key
```

Once authenticated, the authority will obtain inventory metadata and apply any
templates associated with the selected provisioner. That's it. The issued
certificate is ready to use.

```shell-session nocopy
$ step certificate inspect any.crt -short
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 3329...8201]
  Subject:     any-name
               admin@yourco.com
  Issuer:      Prod Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: pass [ID: TvGU...0zXw]
  Valid from:  2021-07-07T22:59:05Z
          to:  2021-07-08T23:00:05Z
```

Renewing this certificate is equally straightforward:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca renew any.crt any.key --force
Your certificate has been saved in any.crt.
```

If you inspect the newly issued certificate, you'll find it has an extended
lifetime.

### One-time Tokens

The `JWK` provisioner is very flexible. Under the hood, it's based on
short-lived one-time tokens that are signed by a private key. The issuing
authority _escrows_ an encrypted copy of the private key. In the password flow
above, `step` obtained the encrypted private key from the issuing authority and
prompted for the password to decrypt it. It generated a one-time token, then
immediately used it to get a certificate.

Instead of broadly distributing the `JWK` provisioner password, we can generate
a token in one place (e.g., CI/CD, configuration management, or orchestration):

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca token alice@yourco.com
```

Then pass the token along for a host, container, or service to obtain a
certificate:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca certificate alice@yourco.com alice.crt alice.key --token $TOKEN
```

### Single Sign-On

Certificates provide a secure, flexible, scalable mechanism for authenticating
people, too (e.g., for SSH access, API access, or to connect to a BeyondCorp
identity-aware proxy). Most organizations already have an identity provider
(IdP) for authenticating people. The `OIDC` provisioner lets you leverage
authentication services from G Suite, Okta, Azure AD, and any other IdP that
supports OAuth OIDC to authenticate a certificate request.

![Developer single sign on for TLS certificate](/graphics/cm-hiw-sso.svg 'The certificate command triggers the OIDC Provisioner and the default browser to open the IDP login screen. The developer authenticates to the corporate single sign-on service and, upon successful completion, returns to the terminal with a personal x.509 certificate.')

```shell-session nocopy
$ step certificate inspect ee.crt -short
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2676...4589]
  Subject:     developer@yourco.com
               05dc4b5d-769a-4659-92ee-9cf5d3b720b3
               https://auth.okta.com#05dc4b5d-769a-4659-92ee-9cf5d3b720b3
  Issuer:      Prod Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: okta [ID: 5310...fc2a]
  Valid from:  2021-06-30T22:52:09Z
          to:  2021-07-01T14:53:09Z
```

### ACME

The `ACME` provisioner implements the
[ACME standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555), created and used
by Let's Encrypt to secure over 260 million public websites. ACME lets you
automatically get a certificate for a domain name or IP address. ACME's rich
client ecosystem makes it especially easy to integrate.

ACME is a simple challenge-response protocol. A client _orders_ a certificate
and the authority responds with a set of _challenges_ for the client to complete
to prove control over the _identifier(s)_ in the order. For example, if a client
orders a certificate for a DNS identifier, the authority may challenge the
client to serve a random number over HTTP from a random path to prove control
over the domain name.

You can use any standards-compliant ACME client to get a certificate from your
Certificate Manager authorities. Here's an example workflow using Certbot, an
open source ACME client maintained by the EFF:

```shell-session nocopy
sudo REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
  certbot certonly -n --standalone -d foo.internal \
  --server https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory
```

ACME works almost anywhere and is especially useful for issuing certificates to
web servers for use with TLS. To issue certificates for internal names that
aren't in public DNS the ACME server does need access to local DNS. It's common
to use a linked CA or a network-local RA. Reference the
[Certificate Manager docs](./acme/README.mdx) for more details.

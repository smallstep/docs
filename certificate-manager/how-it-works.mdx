---

Certificates power modern software. Kubernetes, service meshes, containers,
microservices, distributed databases & queues, configuration management &
orchestration systems, BeyondCorp proxies, and secure software supply chains all
use certificates. Organizations running modern infrastructure make extensive use
of certificates, whether they're aware of it or not.

For many organizations, this is a blind spot, with long-lived certificates
issued manually or from poorly secured deploy pipelines. Secure, reliable
certificate management requires automation. Smallstep Certificate Manager is a
flexible, extensible toolchain with all of the server and client-side components
you'll need to solve this problem, carefully designed to be operationally
simple, easy to use, and hard to misuse.

Certificate Manager builds on two open source projects, maintained by Smallstep:

- `step-ca`: a private online certificate authority for secure automated
  certificate management.
- `step`: a general-purpose cryptography toolkit and the client-side counterpart
  to `step-ca`.

# Certificate lifecycle management
Here's how the elements described in [Core Concepts]() work are used to enable the different stages of a certificate lifecycle management workflow: 

## Bootstrapping trust

Before issuing a certificate, your software and systems must be configured to
trust your authorities. More precisely, you need to configure everything to
trust your _root certificate_ (that is, the certificate that belongs to your root
CA). You can include your root certificate in base images, distribute it using
configuration management, or use
[`step ca bootstrap`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/bootstrap)
or [`step ca root`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/root) to
securely download your root certificate from an issuing authority. You can also
download the root certificate for your authorities from the Certificate Manager
console.

- [`step ca bootstrap`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/bootstrap)
  configures `step` to trust your root CA and use a particular issuing
  authority.
- [`step ca root`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/root)
  securely downloads your root certificate.

Once you've downloaded your root certificate, you can add it to your system's default
trust store using
[`step certificate install`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/install):

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca root root.crt
The root certificate has been saved in root.crt.

$ step certificate install root.crt
Password:
Certificate r.crt has been installed.
X.509v3 Root CA Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 1829...9147]
  Subject:     Root CA
  Issuer:      Root CA
  Valid from:  2020-09-18T20:55:03Z
          to:  2030-09-16T20:55:03Z
```

Or configure software to trust it (see
[Hello mTLS](https://smallstep.com/hello-mtls) for more examples):

```shell-session nocopy
$ cat nginx.conf
server {
    listen                 443 ssl;
    server_name            myserver.internal.net;
    ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/client_certs/root.crt;
    ssl_verify_client      optional;
    location / {
      if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
        return 403;
      }
    }
}
```

## Issuing certificates

**Issuing** a certificate using `step` is simple. In it's most basic form, the
[`step ca certificate`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/certificate)
command provides simple interactive workflows for people to get a certificate
from an issuing authority. Flags and options make scripting and other
non-interactive workflows easy. We'll use several variations of this command in
the examples below.

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca certificate example.com example.crt example.key
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
What provisioner key do you want to use?
  ▸ mike@example.com (JWK) [kid: -6v0dwnSlz2D5opq-B5prQmyD9DhzdJSHMidiu1TjYg]
    sshpop (SSHPOP)
    x5c (X5C)
    Google (OIDC) [client: 650445034027-jsjdrkiskeq9ke99ud2rqkst82ft8uch.apps.googleusercontent.com]
✔ Provisioner: mike@smallstep.com (JWK) [kid: -6v0dwnSlz2D5opq-B5prQmyD9DhzdJSHMidiu1TjYg]
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
✔ CA: https://ca.example.com
✔ Certificate: example.crt
✔ Private Key: example.key
```

## Renewal

Certificates expire. Certificate Manager makes renewing a certificate ahead of
expiration easy. Renewals are authenticated using your existing certificate, and
produce an identical certificate with a new serial number and extended lifetime.

In its most primitive form, renewal is a simple single-command operation:

```shell-session nocopy
step ca renew svc.crt svc.key
```

More than a dozen command-line flags make
[`step ca renew`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/renew)
flexible and easy to integrate into almost any operational environment. For a
taste of what's possible, consider:

```shell-session nocopy
step ca renew --daemon --exec "nginx -s reload" svc.crt svc.key
```

The `--daemon` flag starts a long-running process that will continuously renew
`svc.crt` after 2/3 of its lifetime has elapsed. The `--exec "nginx -s reload"`
option tells Nginx to reload `svc.crt` after each renewal. We even take care of
retries if renewal fail (with exponential backoff and jitter to mitigate denial
of service issues and thundering herds).

`step ca renew` is designed to integrate nicely with `cron` or `systemd`, which
is what we recommend for production deploys. For more details see our
[documentation on production-ready automated renewal](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/certificate-authority-server-production#renewal-using-systemd-timers).

It's also common to trigger renewal from configuration management or from a
container sidecar. Regardless, `step` makes renewal simple and secure.

### Disabling renewal

Finally, sometimes you _don't_ want certificates to be renewed. For example, if
you're issuing certificates using single sign-on (the `OIDC` provisioner), you
probably want your users to re-authenticate with your identity provider
periodically to get a new certificate instead of renewing. Renewal can be
enabled and disabled per-provisioner to accommodate this (it's disabled by
default for the `OIDC` provisioner).

### Renewal after expiry

* This is an Advanced Authority feature

Some use cases demand an option to renew expired certificates.
For example, intermittently-connected devices may not be able to reach the CA in time for a renewal.
The ability to renew expired certificates can be enabled on a per-provisioner basis.
Enable it in the Smallstep console when you create a new provisioner,
or on the command line for an existing provisioner.
While sometimes necessary, this feature comes with risks and is disabled by default.

## Revocation

Certificates should be revoked if they're compromised or no longer needed.
Smallstep Certificate Manager supports both _passive_ and _active_ revocation.

  * **Passive revocation** disables renewal for a particular certificate. The certificate will be trusted until it expires.
  * **Active revocation** explicitly invalidates a certificate ahead of expiry. CRL and OCSP are used to distribute revocation status to relying parties. Active revocation is often necessary for incident response. However, caching, availability, and configuration challenges can make active revocation unreliable. For systems that support it, we've found that revoking authorization can be easier to implement and more reliable than active certificate revocation. We've covered this topic in more detail [on our blog](https://smallstep.com/blog/passive-revocation/).

### Using passive revocation

Passive revocation is on by default and works well in conjunction with short-lived certificates.
To revoke a certificate, run `step ca revoke` and pass the certificate's serial number.

```bash
$ step ca revoke 31952909121245729293840904958100006722
```

Once revoked, the certificate is no longer renewable.

### Using active revocation

Active revocation (CRL and OCSP) is available if you're using an Advanced Authority.
It can be enabled when you create the authority.
To revoke a certificate, you will need either the certificate and its private key (for mutual TLS), or a JWK provisioner (for JWT authentication).
You cannot revoke a certificate using the default administrative OIDC provisioner.

To revoke a certificate using mutual TLS, run:

```bash
$ step ca revoke --cert example.crt --key example.key
```

With a JWK provisioner, to revoke a certificate using JWT authentication, run:

```bash
$ SERIAL=31952909121245729293840904958100006722
$ TOKEN=$(step ca token --provisioner jwk-provisioner --revoke $SERIAL)
$ step ca revoke --token $TOKEN $SERIAL
```

## Observability & alerting

Certificate Manager is designed to support large, rapidly evolving
infrastructures. In these environments, it's easy for a small, unnoticed failure
to cascade into a large outage.

Certificate Manager can alert you ahead of certificate expiry via email or by
calling a [webhook](./webhook-events.mdx). Alerts can be fed into your SIEM or sent to slack so you can
remediate ahead of an outage. Issued certificates are catalogued for easy
auditability. The Certificate Manager interface allows you to sort and filter,
and quickly list and export certificate subjects, issue & expiry dates, issuing
authority, provisioner, and other certificate details.

## Smallstep API

The Smallstep API can be used to manage your authorities programmatically.
The API is currently an alpha release with limited availability.

# Certificate Manager in action

Let's look at how these features come together in a few common workflows.

To configure `step` to use our authority, run:

```shell-session nocopy
step ca bootstrap \
  --ca-url https://prod.yourco.ca.smallstep.com
  --fingerprint 6d04ff00618125114b97870f835c4a28fce2fec91e4b86946147f5c6a5555ff8
```

## Simple password-based issuance

To get a certificate, run `step ca certificate`. You'll be prompted to select a
provisioner. In this example, we'll use the `JWK` provisioner in a
password-based flow:

```shell-session nocopy
 $ step ca certificate admin@yourco.com --san=any-name any.crt any.key
✔ Provisioner: pass (JWK) [kid: x6v0dwnSlz2D5opq-B5prQmyD9DhzdJSHMidiu1TjYg]
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
✔ CA: https://prod.yourco.ca.smallstep.com
✔ Certificate: any.crt
✔ Private Key: any.key
```

Once authenticated, the authority will obtain inventory metadata and apply any
templates associated with the selected provisioner. That's it. The issued
certificate is ready to use.

```shell-session nocopy
$ step certificate inspect any.crt -short
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 3329...8201]
  Subject:     any-name
               admin@yourco.com
  Issuer:      Prod Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: pass [ID: TvGU...0zXw]
  Valid from:  2021-07-07T22:59:05Z
          to:  2021-07-08T23:00:05Z
```

Renewing this certificate is equally straightforward:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca renew any.crt any.key --force
Your certificate has been saved in any.crt.
```

If you inspect the newly issued certificate, you'll find it has an extended
lifetime.

## One-time tokens

The `JWK` provisioner is very flexible. Under the hood, it's based on
short-lived one-time tokens that are signed by a private key. The issuing
authority _escrows_ an encrypted copy of the private key. In the password flow
above, `step` obtained the encrypted private key from the issuing authority and
prompted for the password to decrypt it. It generated a one-time token, then
immediately used it to get a certificate.

Instead of broadly distributing the `JWK` provisioner password, we can generate
a token in one place (for example, CI/CD, configuration management, or orchestration):

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca token alice@yourco.com
```

Then pass the token along for a host, container, or service to obtain a
certificate:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca certificate alice@yourco.com alice.crt alice.key --token $TOKEN
```

## Single sign-on

Certificates provide a secure, flexible, scalable mechanism for authenticating
people, too (for example, for SSH access, API access, or to connect to a BeyondCorp
identity-aware proxy). Most organizations already have an identity provider
(IdP) for authenticating people. The `OIDC` provisioner lets you leverage
authentication services from Google Workspace, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and any other IdP that
supports OAuth OIDC to authenticate a certificate request.

![Developer single sign on for TLS certificate](/graphics/cm-hiw-sso.svg 'The certificate command triggers the OIDC Provisioner and the default browser to open the IDP login screen. The developer authenticates to the corporate single sign-on service and, upon successful completion, returns to the terminal with a personal x.509 certificate.')

```shell-session nocopy
$ step certificate inspect ee.crt -short
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2676...4589]
  Subject:     developer@yourco.com
               05dc4b5d-769a-4659-92ee-9cf5d3b720b3
               https://auth.okta.com#05dc4b5d-769a-4659-92ee-9cf5d3b720b3
  Issuer:      Prod Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: okta [ID: 5310...fc2a]
  Valid from:  2021-06-30T22:52:09Z
          to:  2021-07-01T14:53:09Z
```

## ACME

The `ACME` provisioner implements the
[ACME standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555), created and used
by Let's Encrypt to secure over 260 million public websites. ACME lets you
automatically get a certificate for a domain name or IP address. ACME's rich
client ecosystem makes it especially easy to integrate.

ACME is a simple challenge-response protocol. A client _orders_ a certificate
and the authority responds with a set of _challenges_ for the client to complete
to prove control over the _identifier(s)_ in the order. For example, if a client
orders a certificate for a DNS identifier, the authority may challenge the
client to serve a random number over HTTP from a random path to prove control
over the domain name.

You can use any standards-compliant ACME client to get a certificate from your
Certificate Manager authorities. Here's an example workflow using Certbot, an
open source ACME client maintained by the EFF:

```shell-session nocopy
sudo REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
  certbot certonly -n --standalone -d foo.internal \
  --server https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory
```

ACME works almost anywhere and is especially useful for issuing certificates to
web servers for use with TLS. To issue certificates for internal names that
aren't in public DNS the ACME server does need access to local DNS. It's common
to use a linked CA or a network-local RA. Reference the
[Certificate Manager docs](./acme/README.mdx) for more details.

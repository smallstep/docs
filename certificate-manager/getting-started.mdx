Smallstep [Certificate Manager](https://smallstep.com/certificate-manager) is a commercial product that delivers a managed certificate authority (CA) capable of issuing private x.509 TLS certificates. 

Certificate Manager builds on two open-source projects, maintained by Smallstep:
* `step-ca`: a private online certificate authority for secure automated certificate management.
* `step`: a general-purpose cryptography toolkit and the client-side counterpart to `step-ca`.
With Certificate Manager, you can create your own private CA to manage certificates on internal services, websites, infrastructure, people, or devices. 

### Getting started with Certificate Manager
1. Create a Team and Team Admin
2. Create an Authority
3. Install `step` on your client
4. Configure your client for your Authority

### Before you begin
This tutorial assumes you are setting up Certificate Manager.

If you need SSH certificates instead, see our [documentation for Smallstep SSH](../ssh).

### step 1 - Create a Smallstep Team
Creating a team gives you access to Smallstep's products. 
Click [here](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=cm) to create a team.
You will be asked to provide:
* `Team Name` - Usually, this is your company name. 
* `Team URL` - This is where you will access the Smallstep console and will also be the base domain for the CA URL for any Authorities you create. 
* `First & Last Name` - Smallstep Team administrator's name. 
* `E-mail` - Smallstep Team administrator's e-mail address.
* `password` - This password is used to login into the Smallstep console

Smallstep team admins can subscribe to and manage Smallstep products.

### step 2 - Create an Authority
A Certificate Manager Authority is an online CA that authenticates and authorizes certificate requests.
It can issue, renew, and revoke your x.509 TLS certificates.
To create an Authority:
* Log into the Smallstep console, select the Certificate Manager tab, and click the "Add Authority" button.
* Choose "Create a new hosted Authority".
* Give your Authority a name and subdomain value (the URL path you wish to use for your online CA).
* Choose "Create"
Behind the scenes, Certificate Manager creates a new root and an online intermediate CA,
storing the private keys into [Google's Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management).

  You can bring your own root CA to Smallstep.
  To enable this feature on your account,
  please [Create a Support Ticket](https://support.smallstep.com/en/contact-us).
  Be sure to include your team name.
  This feature requires an Advanced Authority.

</Alert>

On the Authority detail page, you will see the CA URL and Fingerprint used to interact with your CA.

Certificate Manager also creates a default provisioner called `authority-admin`,
connected to your Smallstep login.
You can use this provisioner to administer the Authority and to get certificates. 
See [basic certificate operations](basic-ops.mdx) for examples. 

An *authority super admin* account is also created, using your e-mail address as the admin name/subject. 
The super admin can manage other authority admins.

### Step 3 - Install `step`
To interact with Certificate Manager, you will need our `step` CLI command on your local machine.
`step` acts as a front-end interface to Certificate Manager and is used for many common crypto and X.509 operations.
It's trivial to install the step binary on your local machine.
The instructions are [here](../step-cli/installation.mdx).

### Step 4 - Configure your client
Certificate Manager authorities are administered using the `step` CLI command.
To connect your local client with the hosted Authority, you need to bootstrap into the PKI. 
Run the following command, substituting the values from your Authority's properties:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca bootstrap --ca-url [YOUR CA URL] --fingerprint [YOUR AUTHORITY FINGERPRINT]">
{`$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url [YOUR CA URL] --fingerprint [YOUR AUTHORITY FINGERPRINT]
`}
</CodeBlock>

(You can always find this command on the Quick Actions section on your authority page.)

This command will download the CA Root certificate and configure your local `step` client to interact with the Authority.

If desired, you can also use the `step` CLI to [install](../step-cli/reference/certificate/install) the CA Root certificate to the supported trust stores on your system.

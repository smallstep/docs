## The DevOps practitioners guide

Zero Trust or BeyondProd approaches require authenticated and encrypted communications everywhere.
TLS is the cryptographic protocol that powers encryption for all your technologies.
For TLS, you need certificates.
This series of practitioner's tutorials provide instructions for automating TLS certificates for popular technologies.
Get started quickly with the **try it** path and learn about TLS with your specific technology. 
Then, when ready, follow the **operationalize it** path to automate deployments and certificate management powering server-side encryption. 
The tutorials include configuration options for Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes environments using the ACME protocol, systemd timers, and other modern techniques for certificate management.

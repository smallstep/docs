Need to extend or migrate from an existing CA to a Smallstep CA?

With this tutorial in hand, you can extend your current PKI
by issuing a new intermediate CA (aka subordinate CA)
from your existing root or intermediate CA.
You'll configure `step-ca`
to issue leaf certificates (aka end-entity certificates)
from the new intermediate.
This allows `step-ca` to run independently of your existing CA,
while still issuing certificates trusted by your existing clients.

## Requirements

This tutorial assumes you have initialized and started a `step-ca` instance using the steps in [Getting Started](../step-ca/getting-started.mdx).
You'll also need the ability to sign a new intermediate CA
using your existing CA.
You can use your existing root
or intermediate CA
to sign the new intermediate CA.

## Overview

- [The easy way](#the-easy-way)
- [The medium way](#the-medium-way)
- [The secure way](#the-secure-way)

## The Easy Way

Let's configure `step ca` to
sign a new intermediate for itself
using your existing root CA.

If you have your root CA signing key available, run:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca init --root=[ROOT_CERT_FILE] --key=[ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE]
```
**Note:** The root certificate can be in PEM or DER format, and the signing
key can be a PEM file containing a PKCS#1, PKCS#8, or RFC5915 (for EC) key.

## The Medium Way

If you have your own root certificate and intermediate certificate and key pair
then all you'll need to do is move them to the right locations and update your
`$(step path)/config/ca.json` configuration file.

### 1. Use `step` to generate a boilerplate configuration

It's easiest to run [`step ca init`](../step-cli/reference/ca/init) to get the boilerplate configuration in place, then remove or replace the auto-generated artifacts with new ones that are tied to your existing root CA.

```shell-session 
$ step ca init
```

When you run [`step ca init`](../step-cli/reference/ca/init), it creates artifacts under [`$STEPPATH`](../step-cli/reference/path/) (by default, `$HOME/.step`). The important ones for us are:

 - `$STEPPATH/certs/root_ca.crt` the CA certificate
 - `$STEPPATH/secrets/root_ca_key` the CA signing key
 - `$STEPPATH/certs/intermediate_ca.crt` the intermediate CA cert
 - `$STEPPATH/secrets/intermediate_ca_key` the intermediate signing key used by step-ca

`step-ca` does not actually need the root CA signing key. So you can remove that file:

```shell
$ shred -u $(step path)/secrets/root_ca_key
```

### 2. Import your existing PKI

```shell-session nocopy
$ mv root.crt $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
$ mv intermediate.crt $(step path)/certs/intermediate_ca.crt
$ mv intermediate_ca_key $(step path)/secrets/intermediate_ca_key
```

Verify that the `$(step path)/config/ca.json` is pointing to the correct location
for each of these files.

You may also wish to delete `$(step path)/config/defaults.json`,
if it exists,
and re-run `step ca bootstrap` with your new Root CA fingerprint.

That's it. You should now be able to start `step-ca` and generate X.509 certificates
that can be validated and authenticated by any software that trusts your root
certificate.

## The Secure Way

Let's face it; you probably wouldn't be reading this if you were looking for
the easy way. It's bad practice to move private keys around. Below you will
find the more complex instructions to "bootstrap from an existing PKI" _the
right way_ by generating a CSR, signing it with your existing root, and
configuring `step-ca` to use it. 

### 1. Use `step` to generate a boilerplate configuration

It's easiest to run [`step ca init`](../step-cli/reference/ca/init) to get the boilerplate configuration in place, then remove or replace these artifacts with new ones that are tied to your existing root CA.

```shell-session 
$ step ca init
```

When you run [`step ca init`](../step-cli/reference/ca/init), it creates artifacts under [`$STEPPATH`](../step-cli/reference/path/) (by default, `$HOME/.step`). The important ones for us are:

 - `$STEPPATH/certs/root_ca.crt` the CA certificate
 - `$STEPPATH/secrets/root_ca_key` the CA signing key
 - `$STEPPATH/certs/intermediate_ca.crt` the intermediate CA cert
 - `$STEPPATH/secrets/intermediate_ca_key` the intermediate signing key used by step-ca


`step-ca` does not actually need the root CA signing key. So you can remove that file:

```shell
$ shred -u $(step path)/secrets/root_ca_key
```

### 2. Replace `step-ca`'s root CA cert with your existing root certificate and generate a new signing key and intermediate certificate.

```shell-session nocopy
$ mv /path/to/existing/root.crt $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
```

Now you need to generate a new signing key and intermediate certificate signed by your existing root CA. To do that, we can use the [`step certificate create`](../step-cli/reference/certificate/create) subcommand to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) that we'll have your existing root CA sign, producing an intermediate certificate.

To generate those artifacts run:

```shell
step certificate create "Intermediate CA Name" intermediate.csr intermediate_ca_key --csr
```

In this example, we're generating the Intermediate CA key on the filesystem. For stronger key protection, use our [cryptographic protection](../step-ca/cryptographic-protection.mdx) features to generate the signing key inside a Key Management System (KMS) instead.

### 3. Transfer the CSR file and get it signed.

Now, you will need to transfer the CSR (intermediate.csr) file to your existing root CA and get it signed. Below we have examples of
how to do this using `step`, Active Directory Certificate Services, AWS Certificate Manager Private CA, OpenSSL, and CFSSL.

#### Use `step` to sign your intermediate CSR

```shell
step certificate sign --profile intermediate-ca intermediate.csr root.crt root.key
```

#### Active Directory Certificate Services

```shell
certreq -submit -attrib "CertificateTemplate:SubCA" intermediate.csr intermediate.crt
```

#### AWS Certificate Manager Private CA

You can now use the following python script that uses issue-certificate to process the CSR:

```python nocopy
import boto3
import sys

AWS_CA_ARN = '[YOUR_PRIVATE_CA_ARN]'

csr = ''.join(sys.stdin.readlines())

client = boto3.client('acm-pca')
response = client.issue_certificate(
    CertificateAuthorityArn=AWS_CA_ARN,
    Csr=csr,
    SigningAlgorithm='SHA256WITHRSA',
    TemplateArn='arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen1/V1',
    Validity={
        'Value': 5,
        'Type': 'YEARS'
    }
)
print(f"Creating certificate with ARN {response['CertificateArn']}...", file=sys.stderr, end='')
waiter = client.get_waiter('certificate_issued')
waiter.wait(
    CertificateAuthorityArn=AWS_CA_ARN,
    CertificateArn=response['CertificateArn']
)
print('done.', file=sys.stderr)
response = client.get_certificate(
   CertificateArn=response['CertificateArn'],
   CertificateAuthorityArn=AWS_CA_ARN
)
print(response['Certificate'])
```

To run it, fill in the ARN of your CA and run:

```shell-session nocopy
$ python issue_certificate.py < intermediate.csr > intermediate.crt
```

#### OpenSSL

```shell-session nocopy
openssl ca -config [ROOT_CA_CONFIG_FILE] \
  -extensions v3_intermediate_ca \
  -days 3650 -notext -md sha512 \
  -in intermediate.csr \
  -out intermediate.crt
  ```

#### CFSSL

For CFSSL you'll need a signing profile that specifies a 10-year expiry:
``` shell-session nocopy
$ cat > ca-smallstep-config.json <<EOF
{
  "signing": {
    "profiles": {
      "smallstep": {
        "expiry": "87660h",
        "usages": ["signing"]
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

Now use that config to sign the intermediate certificate:

``` shell-session nocopy
$ cfssl sign -ca ca.pem \
    -ca-key ca-key.pem \
    -config ca-smallstep-config.json \
    -profile smallstep
    -csr intermediate.csr | cfssljson -bare
```

This process will yield a signed intermediate.crt certificate (or cert.pem for CFSSL). Transfer this file back to the machine running step-ca.

### 4. Replace the intermediate.crt and signing key

Finally, replace the intermediate .crt and signing key produced by step ca init with the new ones we just created:

```shell-session nocopy
$ mv intermediate.crt $(step path)/certs/intermediate_ca.crt
$ mv intermediate_ca_key $(step path)/secrets/intermediate_ca_key
```

That's it. You should now be able to start `step-ca` and generate X.509 certificates
that can be validated and authenticated by any software that trusts your root
certificate.

## FAQs

### Can I have multiple intermediate CAs?

Sure. Let's say you have a longer path of intermediate CAs:

Existing Root -> Intermediate 1 -> Intermediate 2 -> `step-ca` Intermediate -> Leaf Certificate

In this setup, you are creating the `step-ca` intermediate.
For this to work, ensure that you're signing your a `step-ca` intermediate using Intermediate 2.

For this to work, your `$(step path)/certs/intermediate_ca.crt` file should be a PEM bundle, in this order:
- `step-ca` Intermediate
- Intermediate 2
- Intermediate 1

It is critical that the `step-ca` intermediate come first in this file.

Finally, `$(step path)/secrets/intermediate_ca_key` will be the signing key for `step-ca` Intermediate.

### Can I configure `step-ca` to sign X.509 leaf certificates from a root CA?

No. Intermediate CAs add a valuable layer of security and indirection to any PKI.
Smallstep CA software requires the use of one or more intermediate CAs.

### Can I have multiple signing CAs?

Sure. Each `step-ca` instance
will only sign using one intermediate CA, however.
If you want multiple signing CAs,
you'll need to run multiple `step-ca`s.

### Instead of signing a new intermediate, can I have my existing online CA perform signing operations on behalf of `step-ca` clients?

Maybe. It depends on which CA software you're using.
You can configure `step-ca`
to run as a [Registration Authority (RA)](../step-ca/registration-authority-ra-mode.mdx).
In this mode, your existing CA continues to sign certificates,
while your `step-ca` (running in RA mode) acts as a front-end interface to your existing CA.

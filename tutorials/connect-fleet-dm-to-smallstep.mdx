description: Connect Fleet DM with Smallstep for device security. Complete guide for deploying certificates to your managed fleet using Fleet's device management platform.

Smallstep can integrate with Fleet DM to deploy certificates to your Fleet-managed devices.

## Requirements

You will need:

- A [Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/signup)
- A [Fleet DM](https://fleetdm.com/) instance


## Configure device sync (coming soon)

To sync your devices from Fleet DM, create an [API-only user](https://fleetdm.com/guides/fleetctl#using-fleetctl-with-an-api-only-user) in Fleet DM, and then put the token into the Fleet settings in Smallstep.

## Configure dynamic SCEP

To configure Fleet to use Dynamic SCEP for certificate issuance to your endpoints, follow the instructions in **[Connect end user to WiFi with certificate (Smallstep)](https://fleetdm.com/guides/connect-end-user-to-wifi-with-certificate#smallstep)**

## Deploy the Smallstep agent

Though not required, we suggest deploying the [Smallstep agent](../platform/smallstep-agent.mdx) to your endpoints. The agent makes it easier to configure endpoints and manage certificates. You can deploy the agent [using Fleet's software management](https://fleetdm.com/guides/deploy-software-packages) and [scripting features](https://fleetdm.com/guides/scripts).

Alternatively, you can use a separate software management system such as [Munki](https://github.com/munki/munki) to deploy the agent. See [install via a software management tool](http://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/connect-jamf-pro-to-smallstep/#option-2-install-via-a-software-management-tool) for details.

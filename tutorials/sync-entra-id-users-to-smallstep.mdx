### Prerequisites

You will need:

* A Smallstep team. [Register here](https://smallstep.com/signup)
* An Entra ID tenant with subscription P1 or higher
* Global Administrator access to the account

### Features

The following provisioning features are supported:

* Push Groups and New Users
* Push Profile or Group Updates
* Push User Deactivation
* Reactivate Users

## Step by step instructions

### Step 1. Create an Entra ID enterprise application

1. In Entra ID, visit [Browse Entra Gallery](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/AppGalleryBladeV2) and choose “+ Create your own application”.
2. Name the application and use the default “Non-gallery” option.
3. In your new Enterprise Application, visit Manage → Users and groups.
4. Assign the groups or users you’d like to sync to Smallstep. You may want to create new groups for Smallstep users.

### Step 2. Enable SSO

#### In Entra ID

1. Your Enterprise Application comes with an App Registration.
2. Go to [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) and find your Smallstep application in the list.
3. In the App Registration, visit “Manage → Certificates & secrets”
4. Create a new Client Secret
5. Set the client secret description and expiry as desired
6. Save the Client ID and Client Secret Value for later
7. Look up your directory's Tenant ID, and save it for later

##### In Smallstep

1. Go to [Connect an Entra ID IdP](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/users/identity-providers/azuread/connect)
2. Fill the Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID you saved.


### Step 3. Enable user provisioning

1. Smallstep will send you a SCIM URL and Secret Token.
2. In Entra ID, return to your Smallstep Enterprise Application.
3. Go to Manage → Provisioning
4. Set the provisioning mode to **Automatic**.
5. Expand **Admin Credentials:**
    - Supply the SCIM **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** you received from Smallstep.
    - Choose **Test Connection** and make sure that it works.
    - Save.

### Step 4. Turn on provisioning

1. Return to the **Provisioning** panel.
2. Choose **Start Provisioning**.

> 🤦‍♂️ There’s a quirk in Microsoft’s UI here, and you may see an error when saving after turning provisioning on. If so, wait 60 seconds and try Save again.

### Step 5. Adjust user attribute mappings

1. In your Smallstep Enterprise Application, the Manage → Attribute Mappings blade should now be accessible. Choose it.
2. Choose "Synchronize Entra ID Active Directory Users to customappsso"
3. The mappings you’ll want for Smallstep are:
    
    ![Entra ID mappings](/graphics/entra-id-mappings.png)
    
    Most of these are part of the default mappings.
    
    The only two you will need to customize are:
    
    - If you're using Smallstep SSH, the `userName` attribute determines the name of a user’s POSIX account. Update  `userName` to map to `ToLower(Replace([userPrincipalName], , "(?<Suffix>@(.)*)", "Suffix", "", , ), )`.
    - Add `externalId`, with a mapping to `objectId`. This should be a unique ID representing the user that is not reusable.

4. Remove any other default attributes that are not in the list above. The only attributes you need to send to Smallstep are:
    - `userName`
    - `displayName`
    - `emails[type eq "work"].value`
    - `name.givenName`
    - `name.familyName`
    - `externalId`
5. Save your user attribute mappings.

### Step 6. Confirm the directory connection

1. Return to the Smallstep dashboard.
2. In the Users tab, you should now see your Entra ID users
3. Sign out
4. You should be offered the option to sign in with SSO.
5. Finally, let Smallstep know which of your SSO users should be team Owners or Admins in Smallstep.
    - Admins have dashboard read/write privileges (users, devices, etc.)
    - Owners have all the same privileges as Admins, with the additional privilege that Owners can create Admins.

> **Don't see your users and groups?** Microsoft's SCIM service may add a 40-minute delay after you set it up. You can force an update by clicking **Restart provisioning** in the Provisioning panel. Even then, it may take a minute to sync with Smallstep.

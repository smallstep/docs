With open source `step-ca`, you can use our provisioners to automate certificate enrollment for almost anything in your production network. To create a cloud VM certificate, we recommend you use the cloud provider metadata API and our IID provisioner. This short tutorial will show how to use Instance Identity Documents (IID) to authorize and retrieve an X.509 Certificate from `step-ca`. 

IIDs are simply credentials that identify an instance's name and owner. By
presenting an IID in a request, a workload can prove that it is running on a cloud VM instance that you own.

## IID-based authentication overview

The major clouds have different names for IIDs: AWS calls them [instance
identity documents][1], GCP calls them [instance identity tokens][2], and Azure
calls them [access tokens][3]. The _metadata_ included in an IID also differs
between clouds, along with many other implementation details. In general,
they're all the same: signed bearer tokens that identify at least the
name and owner of a VM.

Metadata API's expose IIDs via a non-routable IP address
(the [link-local address][4] 169.254.169.254). This magic is orchestrated by
the [hypervisor][5], which identifies the requesting VM and services IID
requests locally.

IIDs are very easy to get from within a VM via one unauthenticated HTTP
request. Barring any security issues, they're impossible to get from anywhere
else.

As an example, let's fetch an IID on GCP. Since GCP encodes IIDs as JWTs and
makes their public keys available at a well-known endpoint, we can easily verify
and decode a GCP IID on the command line using `step`:

```shell-session nocopy
$ curl -s -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"
'http://metadata/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/identity?audience=step-cli&amp;format=full'
| step crypto jwt verify --jwks https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs --aud step-cli --iss https://accounts.google.com { "header": {

Your cloud provider signs IIDs. Therefore, additional API requests are not required.
In addition to being easy for clients, IID-based
authentication is scalable, performant, and highly available.

By fetching an IID from the metadata API and presenting it in an HTTPS request
header a workload can prove that it's running on a VM under your control.
That’s how `step` and `step-ca` use IIDs.

## Getting a certificate from step-ca using IID-based authentication

Here's a diagram of the basic architecture of the `step-ca` IID-based authentication:

![Diagram of the basic architecture of step-ca’s IID-based authentication][6]


To get a certificate from `step-ca` using an IID we need to:

- Generate a key pair and a certificate signing request (CSR) with the workload's name
- Obtain an IID from the metadata API to authenticate to `step-ca`
- Submit the CSR and IID to `step-ca` via HTTPS POST to obtain a certificate
- Store the certificate and private key somewhere our workload can find it

While this is all standards-based and simple in theory, in practice, there’s a
lot of implementation detail to get right. Luckily, the `step` utility
works seamlessly with `step-ca` to do all of this for us.

To demonstrate, assume we have `step-ca` running on AWS with hostname
_ca.local_.

To enable IID-based authentication we’ll [configure][7] `step-ca`,
   adding an AWS-type provisioner.

Find your [AWS account ID][8] to restrict access to our VMs:

![AWS account ID][9]

On the host running `step-ca` add an AWS provisioner to your configuration by running:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText='step ca provisioner add "AWS IID Provisioner" --type AWS --aws-account 123456789042'
>
  {`$ step ca provisioner add "AWS IID Provisioner" --type AWS --aws-account 123456789042`}
</CodeBlock>

Start or restart `step-ca` to pick up this new configuration:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="step-ca $(step path)/config/ca.json"
>
  {`$ step-ca $(step path)/config/ca.json`}
</CodeBlock>

With the `step-ca` server configured and running, let's use the `step ca
bootstrap` command to configure a new VM instance to trust and connect to it:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url https://ca.local --fingerprint f501ed49263c1369bd490a85660ddd4388d4175e0337100a11d4e82eae496499
The root certificate has been saved in ~/.step/certs/root_ca.crt.
Your configuration has been saved in ~/.step/config/defaults.json.
```

The `--fingerprint` is for the root certificate used by `step-ca`. Find it by
running the following command on your CA:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="step certificate fingerprint $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt"
>
  {`$ step certificate fingerprint $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt`}
</CodeBlock>

After bootstrapping, we're ready to get a certificate. If we pass our AWS IID
provisioner name to [`step ca certificate`](../step-cli/reference/ca/certificate) with the `--provisioner` attribute,
`step` will automatically use IID-based authentication to get a certificate:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca certificate foo.local foo.crt foo.key --provisioner "AWS IID Provisioner"
✔ Key ID: AWS IID Provisioner (AWS)
✔ CA: https://ca.local
✔ Certificate: foo.crt
✔ Private Key: foo.key
```

The first positional argument to [`step ca certificate`](../step-cli/reference/ca/certificate) specifies our workload's
name, the certificate subject. In this case, it's _foo.local_. The next two
positional arguments specify which files to write the certificate and private
key, respectively.

We can use [`step certificate inspect`](../step-cli/reference/certificate/inspect) to check our work:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step certificate inspect --short foo.crt
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 4555...1939]
Subject:     foo.local
              ip-172-31-65-180.us-east-1.compute.internal
              172.31.65.180
Issuer:      My Intermediate CA
Provisioner: AWS IID Provisioner [ID: 8074...3263]
Valid from:  2019-07-08T21:39:40Z
       to:  2019-07-09T21:39:40Z
```

Congratulations, that's it. Tell your workload to use _foo.crt_ and _foo.key_,
configure clients to trust X.509 certificates signed by `$(step
path)/certs/root_ca.crt`, and you're good to go. You now have a strong
standards-based mechanism to authenticate workloads and encrypt traffic using
TLS.

## Next steps

Example configurations for GCP and Azure are available in the [step-ca
configuration docs][7]. Instead of account IDs, the GCP IID implementation restricts access
by project and/or service account. Azure restricts access by tenant. The `step
CLI` abstracts away the remaining differences.

Depending on your situation and tech stack, you might put these commands in a
startup script, put them in an AMI, or use configuration management for the
last piece of automation. If you’re using kubernetes, then IID-based
authentication isn’t right for you. Use [ACME][13], [autocert][11] or [cert-manager
integration][12] instead.

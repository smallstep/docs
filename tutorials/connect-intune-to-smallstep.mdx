---

Smallstep can integrate with Microsoft Intune to synchronize your device inventory, to exchange SCEP tokens, and to enroll your fleet with Smallstep using the Smallstep Agent. A SCEP token is a single-use password that's used by devices to get a certificate from Smallstep for bootstrapping.

In this document, we will configure your Microsoft Intune instance for use with your Smallstep team and any Windows endpoints.

To configure the connection, let's first set up an Application in Entra ID. Then, we'll add the client credentials to Smallstep.

# Prerequisites

You will need:

- A [Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/signup)
- A [Microsoft Azure / Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=azurefreeaccount) Tenant. A Global Administrator role is required to grant tenant-wide API consent.
- A [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-intune) Tenant. An Intune Administrator role is required.
- A test device to enroll for management. This can be a Windows VM, but you may need a physical device or additional Wi-Fi adapter if you are testing an Enterprise Wi-Fi connection.

Client requirements:

- The agent will need to reach the following domains:
  ```
  smallstep.com
  api.smallstep.com
  gateway.smallstep.com
  control.infra.smallstep.com
  *.[team-name].ca.smallstep.com
  auth.smallstep.com
  att.smallstep.com
  ```
- Windows 10 (Anniversary Edition) or higher is supported. Windows Home is not supported.

# Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Register an Entra ID Application

You’ll need to register an Application in Entra ID that connects Smallstep to Intune. 

In the Entra Admin Center, [Register an Application](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/CreateApplicationBlade/quickStartType~/null/isMSAApp~/false) with the following properties:

- Name the application “Smallstep”
- Leave all other values alone
- Select **Register**

Find your new App Registration, and copy the **Application (client) ID** value, which you will register with Smallstep later.

Next, visit the **Certificates & secrets** blade.

Select **＋ New client secret**, and use the following properties:

- Name the secret “Smallstep Secret”
- Choose a validity period that matches your security policies. When you rotate the client secret, you will need to update it in your Smallstep settings.
- Select **Add** to create the secret

Copy the **Client Secret Value**, which you will register with Smallstep later.

### 2. Grant API Permissions

Now we’ll connect the App Registration to Intune by adding application permissions.

In the App Registration, visit the **API Permissions** blade.

First, add the following permissions:

- Microsoft Graph → Application permissions → `Application.Read.All`
- Microsoft Graph → Application permissions → `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
- Intune → Application permissions → `scep_challenge_provider`
- Intune → Application permissions → `get_data_warehouse`

Next, select **✓ Grant admin consent** on the API permissions page, and confirm.

Here’s how the Configured permissions should look:

You’ve completed the App Registration setup.

### 3. Configure Smallstep

In Smallstep, navigate to [Settings → Device Management](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/devices).

Configure the Integration with the values you gathered above:

- The Entra ID tenant **Primary domain**, from your [Entra ID Tenant Overview](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/TenantOverview.ReactView) (eg. `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`)
- The App Registration **Application (client) ID**
- The App Registration **Secret Value**

Within a few minutes, you will see all of your Intune devices in the [Devices](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/devices/all) tab. Your Smallstep device inventory is synced approximately every four hours.

### 4. Add the Smallstep Agent for app distribution

**Note:** If you do not want to install the agent via Intune, see our [Smallstep Agent Manual Installation](../platform/smallstep-agent.mdx#windows-installation) guide.

In this step, we’ll add the Smallstep Agent to Intune for distribution to devices.

1. In Intune,
    1. Start at [Windows Apps](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/AppsWindowsMenu/~/windowsApps)
    2. Choose **+ Create**, and then select **Windows App (Win32)**
    3. [Download the Smallstep agent `.intunewin` package for `amd64`](https://files.smallstep.com/intune/step-agent-plugin_amd64.intunewin) and select it for upload in Intune. (Contact Smallstep if you need an `arm64` installer).

        - Choose “Ok”
    - Continue to the Assignments tab
    - For the Assignments tab:
        - Assign the app to devices as desired.
    - On “Review and Create” click **Create**

### 5. Configure Agent Enrollment Policy Set

In this step, we’ll tie everything together by creating Windows policy to enroll devices using the Smallstep Agent.

1. In the Smallstep console, visit [Device Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/devices) and choose your Intune connection.
    1. Select the **Settings** tab from the left-
    2. Download the Root Certificate
    3. Download the Intermediate Certificate
    4. Copy and temporarily save the **SCEP server URL** shown on the page, eg. `https://agents.example.ca.smallstep.com/scep/integration-intune-b967f507`
2. Visit [Team Settings](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/team)
    1. Copy and temporarily save the **Team Name** and **Team ID** values

### 6. Create a Policy in Intune

1. In Intune, choose 🖥️ **Devices**
2. Under the **Manage Devices** tab, Choose **Configuration**

               ```
               Replace `<team-name>` in the “Certificate URI” with your full team name.
               If your team was created before October, 2024,
               your issuer CA may have a common name without the team name ("Smallstep Agents Intermediate CA").
               Not sure? Check your [Authority list](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/cm/authorities).
            4. Leave the other settings as is.

Your Smallstep team is now linked to Intune. The devices that you scoped will receive a certificate and have the agent installed and running.

### Confirmation

There's two ways to confirm installation on an endpoint:

- In the Smallstep UI, go to the device's profile page. In the **Device Registration** section, you'll see an **Enrolled At** timestamp.
- When viewing a Windows/Intune device in the Smallstep UI, you can review device logs to confirm connectivity to the platform and issued certificates.

### Uninstall Smallstep on Intune

In Intune, go to Apps and choose the Smallstep agent app.

Under the Assignments tab, remove all devices from Required and Available sections, and add all devices to the Uninstall section.

description: Connect popular ACME clients to a private ACME server with this ACME protocol client configuration tutorial.
---

The Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol radically simplifies TLS deployment.
With ACME, endpoints can obtain TLS certificates on their own, automatically.
`step-ca` works with any ACME-compliant (specifically, ACMEv2; RFC8555) client.

## About this tutorial

- Learn how to configure popular ACME clients to get certificates from `step-ca`.
- Examples include copy/paste code blocks and specific commands for nginx, certbot, and more.
- When complete, you will have a fully functioning ACME configuration using a private certificate authority. 
- Estimated effort: Reading time ~7 mins, Lab time ~20 to 60 mins. 

If you run into any issues, please let us know [in GitHub Discussions][gh-discussions] or on our [Discord server][discord].

## Requirements

- **Open source -** For `step-ca`, this tutorial assumes you have initialized and started up an instance using the steps in [Getting Started](../step-ca/getting-started.mdx). Additionally, you'll need to configure your CA with an ACME provisioner. Run `step ca provisioner add acme --type ACME`, and restart your CA. 
- **[Smallstep Certificate Manager](../certificate-manager/acme/README.mdx) -** this tutorial assumes you have [created a hosted or linked authority](../certificate-manager/getting-started.mdx) and are running a local [ACME Registration Authority](../registration-authorities/acme-for-certificate-manager.mdx). 

## Overview

Here are the most common configuration parameters for any ACME client:

### Directory URL

Most ACME clients connect to Let’s Encrypt’s CA by default.
To connect to a private CA, you need to point the client your [ACME Directory URL][acme-dir].

[acme-dir]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.1

A single instance of `step-ca` can have multiple ACME provisioners, each with their own ACME Directory URL. The URL follows this form:

`https://{ca-host}/acme/{provisioner-name}/directory`

For example, an ACME provisioner named `ACME` on the host `ca.internal` has the directory URL:

`https://ca.internal/acme/ACME/directory`

### ACME challenge type

You'll need to select the ACME challenge type.

### CA Certificate

Communication between an ACME client and server uses HTTPS.
Many clients will validate the server’s TLS certificate using the public root certificates in your system’s default [trust store][pki-ts].
Some clients will let you pass a CA certificate bundle into the client.

[pki-ts]: https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki/#trust-stores

Clients will validate the server’s HTTPS certificate using the public root certificates in your system’s default trust store.
When you’re connecting to Let’s Encrypt, it’s a public certificate authority and its root certificate is already in your system’s default trust store.
Your internal root certificate isn’t, so HTTPS connections from ACME clients to `step-ca` will fail.

There are two ways to address this challenge.
Either:

- Explicitly configure your ACME client to trust `step-ca`’s root certificate, or
- Add the `step-ca` root certificate to your system’s default trust store.

`step` provides a helper command to do the latter:

```shell
step certificate install
```

If you are using your certificate authority for TLS in production, explicitly configuring your ACME client to only trust your root certificate is a better option.
You will see how this method works with an example below.
You can find several other examples [here](https://smallstep.com/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients).

If you are simulating Let’s Encrypt in pre-production, installing your root certificate is a more realistic simulation of production.
Once your root certificate is installed, no additional client configuration is necessary.

<Alert severity="warning">
  <AlertTitle>A Word of Caution</AlertTitle>
  Adding a root certificate to your system’s default trust store is a global operation. Certificates issued by your CA will be trusted everywhere, including in many web browsers.
</Alert>


### Renewal Period

With most ACME clients, you can configure how often you want to renew your certificates.
Choose a renewal period that is two-thirds of the entire certificate's lifetime, so that you'll have enough time to fix any renewal issues before it's too late.

## Popular ACME Clients

* [Certbot](#certbot)
* [acme.sh](#acmesh)
* [win-acme](#win-acme)
* [Caddy v2](#caddy-v2)
* [NGINX](#nginx)
* [Apache](#apache)
* [Node.js](#node)
* [Golang](#golang)
* [Python](#python)
* [Traefik](#traefik)
* [Certify The Web](#certify-the-web)

### Certbot

[`certbot`](https://certbot.eff.org/) is the granddaddy of all ACME clients.
Built
and supported by [the EFF](https://www.eff.org/), it's the standard-bearer for
production-grade command-line ACME.

To get a certificate from `step-ca` using `certbot` you need to:

1. Point `certbot` at your ACME directory URL using the `--server` flag
2. Tell `certbot` to trust your root certificate using the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable

For example:

```shell
sudo REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
    certbot certonly -n --standalone -d foo.internal \
    --server https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory
```

`sudo` is required in `certbot`'s [_standalone_
mode](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#standalone) so it can listen on
port 80 to complete the `http-01` challenge. If you already have a webserver
running you can use [_webroot_
mode](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot) instead. With the
[appropriate plugin](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins)
`certbot` also supports the `dns-01` challenge for most popular DNS providers.
Deeper integrations with [nginx](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#nginx)
and [apache](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#apache) can even configure
your server to use HTTPS automatically (we'll set this up ourselves later). All
of this works with `step-ca`.

You can renew all of the certificates you've installed using `cerbot` by running:

```shell
sudo REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt certbot renew
```

You can automate renewal with a simple `cron` entry:

```shell
*/15 * * * * root REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt certbot -q renew
```

The `certbot` packages for some Linux distributions will create a `cron` entry
or [systemd
timer](https://stevenwestmoreland.com/2017/11/renewing-certbot-certificates-using-a-systemd-timer.html)
like this for you. This entry won't work with `step-ca` because it [doesn't set
the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment
variable](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/7170). You'll need to
manually tweak it to do so.

More subtly, `certbot`'s default renewal job is tuned for Let's Encrypt's 90
day certificate lifetimes: it's run every 12 hours, with actual renewals
occurring for certificates within 30 days of expiry. By default, `step-ca`
issues certificates with _much shorter_ 24 hour lifetimes. The `cron` entry
above accounts for this by running `certbot renew` every 15 minutes. You'll
also want to configure your domain to only renew certificates when they're
within a few hours of expiry by adding a line like:

```shell
renew_before_expiry = 8 hours
```

to the top of your renewal configuration (e.g., in `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/foo.internal.conf`).

### acme.sh

[acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh) is another popular command-line ACME client. It's written completely in shell (`bash`, `dash`, and `sh` compatible) with very few dependencies.

To get a certificate from `step-ca` using `acme.sh` you need to:

1. Point `acme.sh` at your ACME directory URL using the `--server` flag
2. Tell `acme.sh` to trust your root certificate using the `--ca-bundle` flag

For example:

```
sudo acme.sh --issue --standalone -d foo.internal \
    --server https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory \
    --ca-bundle $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
    --fullchain-file foo.crt \
    --key-file foo.key
```

Like `certbot`, `acme.sh` can solve the `http-01` challenge in [_standalone_ mode](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh#4-use-standalone-server-to-issue-cert) and [_webroot_ mode](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh#2-just-issue-a-cert). It can also solve the `dns-01` challenge for [many DNS providers](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi).

Renewals are slightly easier since `acme.sh` remembers to use the right root certificate. It can also remember how long you'd like to wait before renewing a certificate. Unfortunately, the [duration is specified in days](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/issues/2422) (via the `--days` flag) which is too coarse for `step-ca`'s default 24 hour certificate lifetimes. So the easiest way to schedule renewals with `acme.sh` is to force them at a reasonable frequency, like every 8 hours, via cron:

```
0 */8 * * * root "/home/<user>/.acme.sh"/acme.sh --cron --home "/home/<user>/.acme.sh" --force > /dev/null
```

### win-acme

[win-acme][] (`wacs.exe`) is a popular ACME client for Windows.

To use `win-acme` with `step-ca`, you'll need to do the following:
- Add your root CA certificate (`root_ca.crt`) to the Windows trust store.
- Change the ACMEv2 endpoint used by `win-acme` (in the `settings.json` file that comes with the program) to point to your CA's ACME provisioner (eg. `https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory`). Or pass the `--baseuri` flag with your ACME provisioner's endpoint.
- We recommend using the `tls-alpn-01` challenge type to prove ownership.

[win-acme]:https://www.win-acme.com/

### Caddy v2

[Caddy][] is an HTTP/2 web server with _automatic HTTPS_ powered by an integrated ACME client.
In addition to serving static websites, Caddy is commonly used as a TLS-terminating [API gateway proxy][api-proxy].

[caddy]:https://caddyserver.com/ 
[api-proxy]: https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy

Caddy comes with its own ACME server and by default it will generate an internal CA and issue certificates to itself.
But, you can configure Caddy to use a local `step-ca` instance to obtain certificates.

Here's a `Caddyfile` global config block. 
Add this to the top of your `Caddyfile` to get certificates from `ca.internal` for all configured domains:

```
{
  email carl@smallstep.com
  acme_ca https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory
  acme_ca_root <step path>/root_ca.crt
}
```

Here's a `Caddyfile` that will use `ca.internal` only to get a certificate for `foo.internal`:

```
foo.internal

root * /var/www
tls carl@smallstep.com {
  ca https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory
  ca_root <step path>/certs/root_ca.crt
}
```

Replace `<step path>` with the output of the [`step path`](../step-cli/reference/path/) command.

Now run `caddy` to start serving HTTPS!

```shell
$ sudo caddy start
```

Check your work with curl:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://foo.internal --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt"
>
{`$ curl https://foo.internal --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
 
Hello, TLS!`}
</CodeBlock>

Caddy will automatically renew its certificates after &frac23; of the validity period elapses.

### NGINX

[Nginx][] doesn’t support ACME natively, but you can use a command-line ACME client to get certificates for Nginx to use.

[nginx]: https://www.nginx.com/

Here’s an example `nginx.conf` that runs Nginx in a common configuration where it terminates TLS and proxies to a back-end server listening on local loopback:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name foo.internal;
  ssl_certificate /path/to/foo.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/foo.key;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000
  }
}
```

With this code, you are telling Nginx to listen on port 443 using TLS, with a certificate and private key stored on disk.
[Other resources][nginx-le-docker] provide a more thorough explanation of NGINX's various TLS configuration options.

[nginx-le-docker]: https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71

We can start an HTTP server using python and check our work with curl:

```shell-session nocopy
$ echo "Hello TLS!" > index.html

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &

$ curl https://foo.internal --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt

Hello TLS!
```

Nginx only reads certificates once, only at startup.
When you renew the certificate on disk, Nginx won’t notice.
After each renewal you’ll need to run the following command:

```shell
nginx -s reload
```

You can use the `--exec` flag on the [`step ca renew`](../step-cli/reference/ca/renew) command to do this automatically:

```shell
step ca renew --daemon --exec "nginx -s reload" \
    /path/to/foo.crt \
    /path/to/foo.key
```

If you’re using certbot, check out the `--post-hook` flag to do the same thing.
If you’re using acme.sh, check out the `--reloadcmd` flag.

### Apache

Apache httpd has integrated ACME support via [mod_md][].
You can deploy certificates to Apache in a way similar to what we did for Nginx.

[mod_md]: https://github.com/icing/mod_md

Here’s an example Apache configuration, using certificates issued by `step-ca` through certbot:

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName foo.internal
  DocumentRoot /home/mmalone/www
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.internal/fullchain.pem
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.internal/privkey.pem
</VirtualHost>
```

Start Apache and check your work with curl:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt https://foo.internal"
>
{`$ curl --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt https://foo.internal
 
Hello TLS`}
</CodeBlock>

Like Nginx, Apache needs to be signaled after certificates are renewed by running the following command:

```shell
apachectl graceful
```

### Node

Publish Lab’s [acme-client][plabs-acme] is an excellent ACMEv2 client written in Node.js.
Take a look at an example of how easy it is to obtain a certificate and serve HTTPS in JavaScript: [https://gist.github.com/mmalone/f3c33a2381ffa3d67e86c6d5ad3042c9][js-acme-ex]

[plabs-acme]: https://github.com/publishlab/node-acme-client
[js-acme-ex]: https://gist.github.com/mmalone/f3c33a2381ffa3d67e86c6d5ad3042c9

Most importantly, to make things work:

- Point the ACME client at your ACME directory URL
- Tell the ACME client to trust your CA by configuring the HTTP client to verify certificates using your root certificate

To install dependencies and start the server run:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="npm install node-acme-client && node acme.js"
>
{`npm install node-acme-client
node acme.js
`}
</CodeBlock>

Then check your work with curl:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://foo.internal:11443 --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt"
>
{`$ curl https://foo.internal:11443 \\
    --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
 
Hello, TLS`}
</CodeBlock>

This server supports optional client authentication using certificates and checks if the client authenticated in the handler:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://foo.internal:11443 --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt --cert mike.crt --key mike.key"
>
{`$ curl https://foo.internal:11443 \\
    --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \\
    --cert mike.crt \\
    --key mike.key
 
Hello, mike@smallstep.com`}
</CodeBlock>

### Golang

[lego][] is an ACME client library written in Go.
You can use it to obtain a certificate from `step-ca` programmatically.
You can find an example of this code here: [https://gist.github.com/mmalone/abce3c30df96972ed47f3298543be345](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/abce3c30df96972ed47f3298543be345)

[lego]: https://github.com/go-acme/lego

Essentially, the steps involved are:

- Point lego at your ACME directory URL by setting `lego.Config.CADirUrl`
- Tell lego to trust your CA by configuring an `http.Client` that trusts your root certificate and telling lego to use it

Fetch the required dependencies and start the server:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="go get golang.org/x/net/http2 && go get github.com/go-acme/lego && go run acme.go"
>
{`$ go get golang.org/x/net/http2
$ go get github.com/go-acme/lego
$ go run acme.go
`}
</CodeBlock>

Then test with curl:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://foo.internal:5443 --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt"
>
{`$ curl https://foo.internal:5443 \\
	--cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
 
Hello, TLS!`}
</CodeBlock>

The server is configured to verify client certificates if they are sent.
That means the server is configured to support mutual TLS.
The handler checks whether a client certificate was provided, and responds with a personalized greeting if one was.

You can [get a client certificate from `step-ca`][step-ca-client-cert] using an OAuth/OIDC provisioner:

[step-ca-client-cert]: https://smallstep.com/blog/easily-curl-services-secured-by-https-tls/

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="step ca certificate mike@example.com mike.crt mike.key"
>
{`$ step ca certificate mike@example.com mike.crt mike.key
 
✔ Provisioner: Google (OIDC) [client: <redacted>.apps.googleusercontent.com]
✔ CA: https://ca.internal
✔ Certificate: mike.crt
✔ Private Key: mike.key`}
</CodeBlock>

And test mutual TLS out with curl:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://foo.internal:5443 --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt --cert mike.crt --key mike.key"
>
{`$ curl https://foo.internal:5443 \\
  --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \\
  --cert mike.crt \\
  --key mike.key
  
Hello, mike@example.com!`}
</CodeBlock>

With a few tweaks to this code you can implement robust access control.

There are other good options for programmatic ACME in Go.
The [certmagic][] package builds on lego and offers higher level, easier to use abstractions.
The [x/crypto/acme package][xcrypto-acme] is lower level and offers more control, but it currently implements a pre-standardization draft version of ACME that doesn’t work with `step-ca`.

[certmagic]: https://github.com/mholt/certmagic
[xcrypto-acme]: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/acme

### Python

[certbot][] is written in Python and exposes its acme module as a standalone package.
You can find an example of obtaining a certificate and serving HTTPS in Python here: [https://gist.github.com/mmalone/12f5422b2ec68e64e9d11eae0c6ca47d](https://gist.github.com/mmalone/12f5422b2ec68e64e9d11eae0c6ca47d)

[certbot]: https://certbot.eff.org/

Make sure that you:

- Point the ACME client at your ACME Directory URL
- Tell the ACME client to trust your CA by configuring the injected HTTP client to verify certificates using your root certificate

To install dependencies and start the server, run:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell"
  copyText="pip install acme && pip install pem && python https.py"
>
{`pip install acme
pip install pem
python https.py
`}
</CodeBlock>

Then check your work with curl:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://foo.internal:10443 --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt"
>
{`$ curl https://foo.internal:10443 \\
	--cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
 
Hello, TLS!`}
</CodeBlock>

Like the Go example above, this server also supports mutual TLS and checks if the client authenticated in the handler:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://foo.internal:10443 --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt --cert mike.crt --key mike.key"
>
{`$ curl https://foo.internal:10443 \\
  --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \\
  --cert mike.crt \\
  --key mike.key
 
Hello, mike@smallstep.com!`}
</CodeBlock>

### Traefik

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is a modern reverse-proxy with integrated support for ACME. It's designed primarily to handle ingress for a compute cluster, dynamically routing traffic to microservices and web applications.

#### Traefik v2

It's easy to get a certificate from `step-ca` in Traefik v2, using the `tls-alpn-01` ACME challenge type.

Most importantly, Traefik will need to trust your root CA certificate. Either use the `LEGO_CA_CERTIFICATES` environment variable to provide the full path to your `root_ca.crt` when running `traefik`, or install your root certificate in your system's default trust store by running `step certificate install root_ca.crt`.

In your Traefik static configuration, you'll need to add a `certificatesResolvers` block:

```ini
[certificatesResolvers]
  [certificatesResolvers.myresolver]
    [certificatesResolvers.myresolver.acme]
      caServer = "https://step-ca.internal/acme/acme/directory"
      email = "carl@smallstep.com"
      storage = "acme.json"
      certificatesDuration = 24
      tlsChallenge = true
```

Then, when you add routers to your dynamic configuration for HTTPS traffic, you need to set `tls` and `tls.certresolver`:

```ini
[http]
  [http.routers]
    [http.routers.router1]
	  ...
	  [http.routers.router1.tls]
	    certResolver = "myresolver"
```

If you're running Traefik inside a Docker container, you can get your root CA certificate and add it to the container's trust store by running the following:

```shell-session
$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url "${CA_URL}" --fingerprint "${CA_FINGERPRINT}" --install --force
$ update-ca-certificates
```

#### Traefik v1

To get a certificate from `step-ca` to Traefik v1 you need to:

- Point Traefik at your ACME directory URL using the `caServer` directive in your [configuration file][traefik-config]
- Tell Traefik to trust your root certificate using the LEGO_CA_CERTIFICATES environment variable

[traefik-config]: https://docs.traefik.io/providers/file/

Here’s an example `traefik.toml` file that configures Traefik to terminate TLS and proxy to a service listening on _localhost_:

```ini
defaultEntryPoints = ["http", "https"]
[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.http]
  address = ":80"
  [entryPoints.https]
  address = ":443"
    [entryPoints.https.tls]
[acme]
storage = "acme.json"
caServer = "https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory"
entryPoint = "https"
[acme.httpChallenge]
entryPoint = "http"
[[acme.domains]]
main = "foo.internal"
[file]
[frontends]
  [frontends.foo]
  backend = "foo"
[backends]
  [backends.foo]
    [backends.foo.servers.server0]
      url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
```

Start Traefik by running:

```shell
LEGO_CA_CERTIFICATES=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt traefik
```

Start an HTTP server for Traefik to proxy to, and test with curl:

```shell-session nocopy
$ echo "Hello TLS!" > index.html
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &
$ curl https://foo.internal --cacert $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt

Hello TLS!
```

### Certify The Web

Certify The Web is a popular ACME Certificate Manager for Windows. It provides a full UI for managing thousands of certificates, supports a wide range of built in deployment tasks and integrates with many DNS API providers. Commercial licensing and support is also available.

To use with `step-ca`:
- Add your CA root certificate to *Local Machine > Trusted Certificate Authorities* and your CA intermediate to *Local Machine > Intermediate Certification Authorities*. This will make your endpoint certificate (and the other ACME certificates you issue from your CA) trusted on this machine.
- Add your `step-ca` instance details as a new Certificate Authority under *Settings > Certificate Authorities*. You can set the Production and Staging API urls either to the same directory endpoint or point them to different instances if you are operating a split staging and production configuration.
- Add a CA account for your new CA under *Settings > Certificate Authorities > New Account*, selecting your new CA from the list.
- Select *New Certificate* to begin ordering a new certificate from your CA. Make sure to set your CA preference under Certificate > Advanced > Certificate Authority (or you can set this as a global setting). You can use HTTP or DNS validation. Select *Request Certificate* to perform your certificate order. Subsequent renewals are automatic.
- By default the certificate will be added to the local machine certificate store. It can also be automatically deployed to IIS sites on the same machine, or you can use [Deployment Tasks](https://docs.certifytheweb.com/docs/deployment/tasks_intro) to push certificates to secrets vaults or to remote machines via SFTP (windows or linux etc) or to UNC shares etc.

Smallstep can integrate with [Omnissa Workspace ONE UEM](https://www.omnissa.com/products/workspace-one-unified-endpoint-management/) to keep your device inventory in sync and to exchange SCEP tokens. A SCEP token is a single-use password that's used by devices to get a certificate from Smallstep.

To configure the connection, let’s first set up an Application in Entra ID. Then, we’ll add the client credentials to Smallstep.

# Prerequisites

You will need:

- A [Smallstep team](https://smallstep.com/signup)
- A [Workspace ONE UEM](https://www.omnissa.com/products/workspace-one-unified-endpoint-management/) tenant
- A test device to enroll for management
    - This can be a Windows VM, but you may need a physical device or additional Wi-Fi adapter for testing an Enterprise Wi-Fi connection. Windows Home edition is not supported.

# Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Connect Smallstep to Workspace ONE via OAuth

First, we’ll create a scoped API role for Smallstep:

1. In Workspace ONE UEM, navigate to **Accounts → Admin Roles** and choose **+ Add Role**
2. Create a role named “Smallstep” with a description of “Smallstep Integration”
3. Smallstep needs Read access to Devices, using the REST API. Choose API → REST on the left, and choose ✅ Read for the row “Devices”
    
    ![Workspace ONE API Panel](/graphics/workspace-one-api-panel.png)
 
4. Choose **Save**

Next, we’ll create an OAuth client for Smallstep:

1. In Workspace ONE UEM, navigate to **Groups & Settings → Configurations** and find **OAuth Client Management** in the list
2. Choose **Add** and add a new client with a name of “Smallstep” and description of “Smallstep MDM Integration for Device Sync”
3. For **Organization Group**, select the group most appropriate for managing your desired device inventory
4. For **Role**, choose **Smallstep**
5. Choose **Save**
6. Copy the resulting client ID and secret value

### 2. Configure Smallstep OAuth settings

In Smallstep, navigate to [Settings → Device Management](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/settings/devices).

Configure a new Omnissa Workspace ONE Integration with the values you gathered above:

- The Workspace ONE UEM REST API URL for your tenant.
    - This URL is shown in UEM’s settings. Navigate to  
      **Groups and Settings** → **All Settings →** **System** → **Advanced** → **API** → **Rest API**
    - Copy the REST API URL from that page
- The Workspace ONE UEM [OAuth 2.0 Token URL for your region](https://docs.omnissa.com/bundle/WorkspaceONE-UEM-Console-BasicsVSaaS/page/UsingUEMFunctionalityWithRESTAPI.html#datacenter_and_token_urls_for_oauth_20_support)
- The OAuth client ID and secret you saved in Step 1

After saving the Workspace ONE connection, you will see settings for your integration. Copy the following details for later:

- SCEP URL
- SCEP Challenge URL
- Challenge Basic Authentication Username
- Challenge Basic Authentication Password

Within a few minutes after adding the connection, you should see all of your Workspace ONE devices in the [Devices](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/devices/all) tab. Device inventory is synced approximately every four hours.

### 3. Create a script for Smallstep Agent configuration

1. In Workspace One UEM, visit **Resources → Scripts**
2. Choose **Add** and then **Windows**
    1. In the General tab, provide a name for the script, such as “Smallstep Agent Enrollment”
    2. On the Details tab, ensure the **Language** is “Poweshell” and the **Execution Context & Privileges** is “System Context”
    3. Use the following snippet as the **Code**, making sure to replace `<team-id>` with the Team ID value you copied from the Smallstep UI earlier.
        
        ```xml
        New-Item -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Smallstep"
        Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Smallstep" -Name "TeamSlug" -Value "<team-id>"
        Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\Smallstep" -Name "Certificate" -Value "capi:store-location=machine;store=My;issuer=Smallstep (<team-id>) Agents Intermediate CA;cn=$env:DEVICE_ID"
        ```
        
       If your team was created before October, 2024,
       your issuer CA may have a common name without the team slug ("Smallstep Agents Intermediate CA").
       Not sure? Check your [Authority list](https://smallstep.com/app/?next=/cm/authorities).
    4. In the Variables tab, click **Add**. Set the variable **Key** to `DEVICE_ID` and the variable **Value** to `{DeviceUuId}` 

### 4. Deploy and configure the Smallstep Agent

In this step, we’ll add the Smallstep Agent to Workspace One UEM for distribution to devices.

- [Download the Smallstep Agent for x64](https://packages.smallstep.com/stable/windows/step-agent-plugin_latest_amd64.msi)
- [Download the Smallstep Agent for Arm64](https://packages.smallstep.com/stable/windows/step-agent-plugin_latest_arm64.msi)

1. In Workspace One UEM,
    - Go to Resources → Native Apps.
    - Choose Add → Application File.
    - Download the latest version of the agent from the links above and select it for upload to UEM.
    - Choose **Continue**
2. In the Add Application panel’s **Details tab**,
    - Set Supported Processor Architecture to `64-bit` (or `ARM64` if used)
    - For Minimum OS, select Windows 10 (10.0.15063)
3. In the Add Application panel’s **Deployment Options** tab,
    - Set Install Context to **Device**
4. FInally, choose **Save & Assign**

<Alert severity="info">
<div>
    **Got ARM64 devices?**<br />
    If you also are deploying to ARM-based devices, add another Native App for the `arm64` version of our [MSI installer](https://github.com/smallstep/step-agent-plugin/releases/latest). Workspace ONE will try to distribute *both* installers to both `arm64` and `amd64` devices. To avoid this, segregate your devices by OS and CPU Architecture. To do this, create two new Smart Groups in **Groups & Settings → Assignment Groups**—one for `arm64` devices, and one for `amd64` devices. Assign each application to the appropriate Smart Group.
</div>
</Alert>

#### Assigning the application

After saving the Native App, you'll see the Application Assignment panel.

1. Give the Assignment a name
2. Choose the groups you’d like to assign the application to. Assign the app to a single devices or a small group of test devices for a staged rollout.
3. Select App Delivery Method: Auto
4. Create the Assignment.
5. Choose **Save**
6. Choose **Publish** to begin distributing the app.

### 5. Configure Agent Enrollment Profiles

In this step, we’ll tie everything together by creating Windows policy to enroll devices using the Smallstep Agent.

3. For the subject name, use a value of `CN={DeviceUuid}`
4. For Private Key Length, use 2048
5. For Private Key Type, choose both Signing and Encryption
6. Add a new SAN Type of type URL, and set the value to `deviceid://{DeviceUuid}`
7. For Automatic Certificate Renewal, choose Enabled
    - Pick an appropriate Auto Renewal Period (5 days is common)
8. Ensure Publish Private Key is Disabled
9. Choose **Save**

#### Create a Windows Profile

1. In Workspace One UEM,
    1. Go to Resources → Profiles.
    2. Click Add, and pick Add Profile from the drop-down
